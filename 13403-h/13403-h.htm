<p>This essay was written in 1908-1910 while I was studying at Oxford as
Fellow of the Society of American Women in London. Material on the subject
of travel in any century is apparently inexhaustible, and one could write
many books on the subject without duplicating sources. The following aims
no further than to describe one phase of Renaissance travel in clear and
sharp outline, with sufficient illustration to embellish but not to clog
the main ideas.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this book I incurred many debts of gratitude. I
would thank the staff of the Bodleian, especially Mr W.H.B. Somerset, for
their kindness during the two years I was working in the library of Oxford
University; and Dr Perlbach, Abteilungsdirektor of the K&ouml;nigliche
Bibliothek at Berlin, who forwarded to me some helpful information
concerning the early German books of instructions for travellers; and
Professor Clark S. Northup, of Cornell University, for similar aid. To Mr
George Whale I am indebted for the use of his transcript of Sloane <a
name="Page_i6"></a>MS. 1813, and to my friend Miss M.E. Marshall, of the
Board of Trade, for the generous gift of her leisure hours in reading for
me in the British Museum after the sea had divided me from that
treasure-house of information.</p>

<p>I would like to acknowledge with thanks the kind advice of Sir Walter
Raleigh and Sir Sidney Lee, whose generosity in giving time and scholarship
many students besides myself are in a position to appreciate. Mr L.
Pearsall Smith, from whose work on the <i>Life and Letters of Sir Henry
Wotton</i> I have drawn copiously, gave me also courteous personal
assistance.</p>

<p>To the Faculty of the English Department at Columbia University I owe
the gratitude of one who has received her earliest inclination to
scholarship from their teachings. I am under heavy obligations to Professor
A.H. Thorndike and Professor G.P. Krapp for their corrections and
suggestions in the proof-sheets of this book, and to Professor W.P. Trent
for continued help and encouragement throughout my studies at Columbia and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Above all, I wish to emphasize the aid of Professor C.H. Firth, of
Oxford University, <a name="Page_i7"></a>whose sympathy and comprehension
of the difficulties of a beginner in the field he so nobly commands can be
understood only by those, like myself, who come to Oxford aspiring and
alone. I wish this essay were a more worthy result of his influence.</p>

<a name="Page_i9"></a><h2><a name='INTRODUCTION'></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Among the many didactic books which flooded England in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries were certain essays on travel. Some of these have
never been brought to light since their publication more than three hundred
years ago, or been mentioned by the few writers who have interested
themselves in the literature of this subject. In the collections of voyages
and explorations, so often garnered, these have found no place. Most of
them are very rare, and have never been reprinted. Yet they do not deserve
to be thus overlooked, and in several ways this survey of them will, I
think, be useful for students of literature.</p>

<p>They reveal a widespread custom among Elizabethan and Jacobean
gentlemen, of completing their education by travel. There are scattered
allusions to this practice, in contemporary social documents: Anthony
&agrave; Wood frequently explains how such an Oxonian "travelled beyond
seas and returned a compleat Person,"--but nowhere is this ideal of a
cosmopolitan education so explicitly set forth as it is in these essays.
Addressed to the intending tourist, they are in no sense to be confused
with guide-books or itineraries. <a name="Page_i10"></a>They are
discussions of the benefits of travel, admonitions and warnings, arranged
to put the traveller in the proper attitude of mind towards his great task
of self-development. Taken in chronological order they outline for us the
life of the travelling student.</p>

<p>Beginning with the end of the sixteenth century when travel became the
fashion, as the only means of acquiring modern languages and modern
history, as well as those physical accomplishments and social graces by
which a young man won his way at Court, they trace his evolution up to the
time when it had no longer any serious motive; that is, when the chairs of
modern history and modern languages were founded at the English
universities, and when, with the fall of the Stuarts, the Court ceased to
be the arbiter of men's fortunes. In the course of this evolution they show
us many phases of continental influence in England; how Italian immorality
infected young imaginations, how the Jesuits won travellers to their
religion, how France became the model of deportment, what were the origins
of the Grand Tour, and so forth.</p>

<p>That these directions for travel were not isolated oddities of
literature, but were the expression of a widespread ideal of the English
gentry, I have tried to show in the following study. The essays can hardly
be appreciated without support from <a name="Page_i11"></a>biography and
history, and for that reason I have introduced some concrete illustrations
of the sort of traveller to whom the books were addressed. If I have not
always quoted the "Instructions" fully, it is because they repeat one
another on some points. My plan has been to comment on whatever in each
book was new, or showed the evolution of travel for study's sake.</p>

<p>The result, I hope, will serve to show something of the cosmopolitanism
of English society in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; of the
closer contact which held between England and the Continent, while England
was not yet great and self-sufficient; of times when her soldiers of low
and high degree went to seek their fortunes in the Low Countries, and her
merchants journeyed in person to conduct business with Italy; when a steady
stream of Roman Catholics and exiles for political reasons trooped to
France or Flanders for years together.</p>

<p>These discussions of the art of travel are relics of an age when
Englishmen, next to the Germans, were known for the greatest travellers
among all nations. In the same boat-load with merchants, spies, exiles, and
diplomats from England sailed the young gentleman fresh from his
university, to complete his education by a look at the most civilized
countries of the world. He approached <a name="Page_i12"></a>the Continent
with an inquiring, open mind, eager to learn, quick to imitate the
refinements and ideas of countries older than his own. For the same purpose
that now takes American students to England, or Japanese students to
America, the English striplings once journeyed to France, comparing
governments and manners, watching everything, noting everything, and coming
home to benefit their country by new ideas.</p>

<p>I hope, also, that a review of these forgotten volumes may lend an added
pleasure to the reading of books greater than themselves in Elizabethan
literature. One cannot fully appreciate the satire of Amorphus's claim to
be "so sublimated and refined by travel," and to have "drunk in the spirit
of beauty in some eight score and eighteen princes' courts where I have
resided,"<sup><a href="#fn1" name="rfn1">[1]</a></sup> unless one has read
of the benefits of travel as expounded by the current Instructions for
Travellers; nor the dialogues between Sir Politick-Would-be and Peregrine
in <i>Volpone, or the Fox</i>. Shakespeare, too, in <i>The Two Gentlemen of
Verona</i>, has taken bodily the arguments of the Elizabethan orations in
praise of travel:</p>
<blockquote>
"Some to the warres, to try their fortune there;<br />
Some, to discover Islands farre away;<br />
Some, to the studious Universities;<br />
<a name="Page_i13"></a>For any, or for all these exercises,<br />
He said, thou Proteus, your sonne was meet;<br />
And did request me, to importune you<br />
To let him spend his time no more at home;<br />
Which would be great impeachment to his age,<br />
In having knowne no travaile in his youth.<br />
(Antonio) Nor need'st thou much importune me to that<br />
Whereon, this month I have been hamering,<br />
I have considered well, his losse of time,<br />
And how he cannot be a perfect man,<br />
Not being tryed, and tutored in the world;<br />
Experience is by industry atchiev'd,<br />
And perfected by the swift course of time."<br />

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF TRAVEL FOR CULTURE</h3>


<p>Of the many social impulses that were influenced by the Renaissance, by
that "new lernynge which runnythe all the world over now-a-days," the love
of travel received a notable modification. This very old instinct to go
far, far away had in the Middle Ages found sanction, dignity and
justification in the performance of pilgrimages. It is open to doubt
whether the number of the truly pious would ever have filled so many ships
to Port Jaffa had not their ranks been swelled by the restless, the
adventurous, the wanderers of all classes.</p>

<p>Towards the sixteenth century, when curiosity about things human was an
ever stronger undercurrent in England, pilgrimages were particularly
popular. In 1434, Henry VI. granted licences to 2433 pilgrims to the shrine
of St James of Compostella alone.<sup><a href="#fn2"
name="rfn2">[2]</a></sup> The numbers were so large that the control of
their transportation became a coveted business enterprise. "Pilgrims at
this time were really an article of exportation," says <a
name="Page_4"></a>Sir Henry Ellis, in commenting on a letter of the Earl of
Oxford to Henry VI., asking for a licence for a ship of which he was owner,
to carry pilgrims. "Ships were every year loaded from different ports with
cargoes of these deluded wanderers, who carried with them large sums of
money to defray the expenses of their journey."<sup><a href="#fn3"
name="rfn3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Among the earliest books printed in England was <i>Informacon for
Pylgrymes unto the Holy Londe,</i> by Wynkin de Worde, one which ran to
three editions,<sup><a href="#fn4" name="rfn4">[4]</a></sup> an almost
exact copy of William Wey's "prevysyoun" (provision) for a journey
eastwards.<sup><a href="#fn5" name="rfn5">[5]</a></sup> The tone and
content of this <i>Informacon</i> differ very little from the later
Directions for Travellers which are the subject of our study. The advice
given shows that the ordinary pilgrim thought, not of the ascetic
advantages of the voyage, or of simply arriving in safety at his holy
destination, but of making the trip in the highest possible degree of
personal comfort and pleasure. He is advised to take with him two barrels
of wine ("For yf ye wolde geve xx dukates for a barrel ye shall none have
after that ye passe moche Venyse"); to buy orange-ginger, almonds, rice,
figs, cloves, maces and loaf sugar <a name="Page_5"></a>also, to eke out
the fare the ship will provide. And this although he is to make the patron
swear, before the pilgrim sets foot in the galley, that he will serve "hote
meete twice at two meals a day." He whom we are wont to think of as a poor
wanderer, with no possessions but his grey cloak and his staff, is warned
not to embark for the Holy Land without carrying with him "a lytell
cawdron, a fryenge panne, dysshes, platers, cuppes of glasse ... a fether
bed, a matrasse, a pylawe, two payre sheets and a quylte" ... a cage for
half a dozen of hens or chickens to have with you in the ship, and finally,
half a bushel of "myle sede" to feed the chickens. Far from being
encouraged to exercise a humble and abnegatory spirit on the voyage, he is
to be at pains to secure a berth in the middle of the ship, and not to mind
paying fifty ducats for to be in a good honest place, "to have your ease in
the galey and also to be cherysshed." Still more unchristian are the
injunctions to run ahead of one's fellows, on landing, in order to get the
best quarters at the inn, and first turn at the dinner provided; and above
all, at Port Jaffa, to secure the best ass, "for ye shall paye no more for
the best than for the worste."</p>

<p>But while this book was being published, new forces were at hand which
were to strip the thin <a name="Page_6"></a>disguise of piety from pilgrims
of this sort. The Colloquies of Erasmus appeared before the third edition
of <i>Informacon for Pylgrymes</i>, and exploded the idea that it was the
height of piety to have seen Jerusalem. It was nothing but the love of
change, Erasmus declared, that made old bishops run over huge spaces of sea
and land to reach Jerusalem. The noblemen who flocked thither had better be
looking after their estates, and married men after their wives. Young men
and women travelled "non sine gravi discrimine morum et integritatis."
Pilgrimages were a dissipation. Some people went again and again and did
nothing else all their lives long.<sup><a href="#fn6"
name="rfn6">[6]</a></sup> The only satisfaction they looked for or received
was entertainment to themselves and their friends by their remarkable
adventures, and ability to shine at dinner-tables by recounting their
travels.<sup><a href="#fn7" name="rfn7">[7]</a></sup> There was no harm in
going sometimes, but it was not pious. And people could spend their time,
money and pains on something which was truly pious.<sup><a href="#fn8"
name="rfn8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was only a few years after this that that pupil of Erasmus and his
friends, King Henry the Eighth, who startled Europe by the way he not only
received new ideas but acted upon them, <a name="Page_7"></a>swept away the
shrines, burned our Lady of Walsingham and prosecuted "the holy blisful
martyr" Thomas &agrave; Becket for fraudulent pretensions.<sup><a
href="#fn9" name="rfn9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>But a new object for travel was springing up and filling the leading
minds of the sixteenth century--the desire of learning, at first hand, the
best that was being thought and said in the world. Humanism was the new
power, the new channel into which men were turning in the days when "our
naturell, yong, lusty and coragious prynce and sovrayne lord King Herre the
Eighth entered into the flower of pleasaunt youthe."<sup><a href="#fn10"
name="rfn10">[10]</a></sup> And as the scientific spirit or the socialistic
spirit can give to the permanent instincts of the world a new zest, so the
Renaissance passion for self-expansion and for education gave to the old
road a new mirage.</p>

<p>All through the fifteenth century the universities of Italy, pre-eminent
since their foundation for secular studies, had been gaining reputation by
their offer of a wider education than the threadbare discussions of the
schoolmen. The discovery and revival in the fifteenth century of Greek
literature, which had stirred Italian society so profoundly, gave to the
universities a northward-spreading fame. Northern scholars, like Rudolf
Agricola, <a name="Page_8"></a>hurried south to find congenial air at the
centre of intellectual life. That professional humanists could not do
without the stamp of true culture which an Italian degree gave to them,
Erasmus, observer of all things, notes in the year 1500 to the Lady of
Veer:</p>

<p>"Two things, I feel, are very necessary: one that I go to Italy, to gain
for my poor learning some authority from the celebrity of the place; the
other, that I take the degree of Doctor; both senseless, to be sure. For
people do not straightway change their minds because they cross the sea, as
Horace says, nor will the shadow of an impressive name make me a whit more
learned ... but we must put on the lion's skin to prove our ability to
those who judge a man by his title and not by his books, which in truth
they do not understand."<sup><a href="#fn11"
name="rfn11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although Erasmus despised degree-hunting, it is well known that he felt
the power of Italy. He was tempted to remain in Rome for ever, by reason of
the company he found there. "What a sky and fields, what libraries and
pleasant walks and sweet confabulation with the learned ..."<sup><a
href="#fn12" name="rfn12">[12]</a></sup> <a name="Page_9"></a>he exclaims,
in afterwards recalling that paradise of scholars. There was, for instance,
the Cardinal Grimani, who begged Erasmus to share his life ... and
books.<sup><a href="#fn13" name="rfn13">[13]</a></sup> And there was Aldus
Manutius. We get a glimpse of the Venetian printing-house when Aldus and
Erasmus worked together: Erasmus sitting writing regardless of the noise of
printers, while Aldus breathlessly reads proof, admiring every word. "We
were so busy," says Erasmus, "we scarce had time to scratch our
ears."<sup><a href="#fn14" name="rfn14">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was this charm of intellectual companionship which started the whole
stream of travel <i>animi causa</i>. Whoever had keen wits, an agile mind,
imagination, yearned for Italy. There enlightened spirits struck sparks
from one another. Young and ardent minds in England and in Germany found an
escape from the dull and melancholy grimness of their uneducated
elders--purely practical fighting-men, whose ideals were fixed on a
petrified code of life.</p>

<p>I need not explain how Englishmen first felt this charm of urbane
civilization. The travels of Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, of Gunthorpe,
Flemming, Grey and Free, have been recently described by Mr Einstein in
<i>The Italian Renaissance in England</i>. As for Italian journeys of <a
name="Page_10"></a>Selling, Grocyn, Latimer, Tunstall, Colet and Lily, of
that extraordinary group of scholars who transformed Oxford by the
introduction of Greek ideals and gave to it the peculiar distinction which
is still shining, I mention them only to suggest that they are the source
of the Renaissance respect for a foreign education, and the founders of the
fashion which, in its popular spreadings, we will attempt to trace. They
all studied in Italy, and brought home nothing but good. For to scholarship
they joined a native force of character which gave a most felicitous
introduction to England of the fine things of the mind which they brought
home with them. By their example they gave an impetus to travel for
education's sake which lesser men could never have done.</p>

<p>Though through Grocyn, Linacre and Tunstall, Greek was better taught in
England than in Italy, according to Erasmus,<sup><a href="#fn15"
name="rfn15">[15]</a></sup> at the time Henry VIII. came to the throne, the
idea of Italy as the goal of scholars persisted. Rich churchmen, patrons of
letters, launched promising students on to the Continent to give them a
complete education; as Richard Fox, Founder of Corpus Christi, sent Edward
Wotton to Padua, "to improve his learning and chiefly to learn
Greek,"<sup><a href="#fn16" name="rfn16">[16]</a></sup> or Thomas <a
name="Page_11"></a>Langton, Bishop of Winchester, supported Richard Pace at
the same university.<sup><a href="#fn17" name="rfn17">[17]</a></sup> To
Reginald Pole, the scholar's life in Italy made so strong an appeal that he
could never be reclaimed by Henry VIII. Shunning all implication in the
tumult of the political world, he slipped back to Padua, and there
surrounded himself with friends,--"singular fellows, such as ever absented
themselves from the court, desiring to live holily."<sup><a href="#fn18"
name="rfn18">[18]</a></sup> To his household at Padua gravitated other
English students fond of "good company and the love of learned men"; Thomas
Lupset,<sup><a href="#fn19" name="rfn19">[19]</a></sup> the confidant of
Erasmus and Richard Pace; Thomas Winter,<sup><a href="#fn20"
name="rfn20">[20]</a></sup> Wolsey's reputed natural son; Thomas
Starkey,<sup><a href="#fn21" name="rfn21">[21]</a></sup> the historian;
George Lily,<sup><a href="#fn22" name="rfn22">[22]</a></sup> son of the
grammarian; Michael Throgmorton, and Richard Morison,<sup><a href="#fn23"
name="rfn23">[23]</a></sup> ambassador-to-be.</p>

<p>There were other elements that contributed to the growth of travel
besides the desire to become exquisitely learned. The ambition of Henry <a
name="Page_12"></a>VIII. to be a power in European politics opened the
liveliest intercourse with the Continent. It was soon found that a special
combination of qualities was needed in the ambassadors to carry out his
aspirations. Churchmen, like the ungrateful Pole, for whose education he
had generously subscribed, were often unpliable to his views of the Pope; a
good old English gentleman, though devoted, might be like Sir Robert
Wingfield, simple, unsophisticated, and the laughingstock of
foreigners.<sup><a href="#fn24" name="rfn24">[24]</a></sup> A courtier,
such as Lord Rochford, who could play tennis, make verses, and become
"intime" at the court of Francis I., could not hold his own in disputes of
papal authority with highly educated ecclesiastics.<sup><a href="#fn25"
name="rfn25">[25]</a></sup> Hence it came about that the choice of an
ambassador fell more and more upon men of sound education who also knew
something of foreign countries: such as Sir Thomas Wyatt, or Sir Richard
Wingfield, of Cambridge and Gray's Inn, who had studied at Ferrara<sup><a
href="#fn26" name="rfn26">[26]</a></sup>; Sir Nicholas Wotton, who had
lived in Perugia, and graduated doctor of civil and canon law<sup><a
href="#fn27" name="rfn27">[27]</a></sup>; or Anthony St Lieger, who,
according to Lloyd, "when twelve <a name="Page_13"></a>years of age was
sent for his grammar learning with his tutor into France, for his carriage
into Italy, for his philosophy to Cambridge, for his law to Gray's Inn: and
for that which completed all, the government of himself, to court; where
his debonairness and freedom took with the king, as his solidity and wisdom
with the Cardinal."<sup><a href="#fn28" name="rfn28">[28]</a></sup>
Sometimes Henry was even at pains to pick out and send abroad promising
university students with a view to training them especially for diplomacy.
On one of his visits to Oxford he was impressed with the comely presence
and flowing expression of John Mason, who, though the son of a cowherd, was
notable at the university for his "polite and majestick speaking."</p>

<p>King Henry disposed of him in foreign parts, to add practical experience
to his speculative studies, and paid for his education out of the king's
Privy Purse, as we see by the royal expenses for September 1530. Among such
items as "&pound;8, 18s. to Hanybell Zinzano, for drinks and other
medicines for the King's Horses"; and, "20s. to the fellow with the dancing
dog," is the entry of "a year's exhibition to Mason, the King's scholar at
Paris, &pound;3, 6s. 8d."<sup><a href="#fn29"
name="rfn29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another educational investment of the King's <a name="Page_14"></a>was
Thomas Smith, afterwards as excellent an ambassador as Mason, whom he
supported at Cambridge, and according to Camden, at riper years made choice
of to be sent into Italy. "For even till our days," says Camden under the
year 1577, "certain young men of promising hopes, out of both Universities,
have been maintained in foreign countries, at the King's charge, for the
more complete polishing of their Parts and Studies."<sup><a href="#fn30"
name="rfn30">[30]</a></sup> The diplomatic career thus opened to young
courtiers, if they proved themselves fit for service by experience in
foreign countries, was therefore as strong a motive for travel as the
desire to reach the source of humanism.</p>

<p>This again merged into the pursuit of a still more informal
education--the sort which comes from "seeing the world." The marriage of
Mary Tudor to Louis XII., and later the subtle bond of humanism and high
spirits which existed between Francis I. and his "very dear and
well-beloved good brother, cousin and gossip, perpetual ally and perfect
friend," Henry the Eighth, led a good many of Henry's courtiers to attend
the French court at one time or another--particularly the most dashing
favourites, and leaders of fashion, the "friskers," as Andrew Boorde calls
them,<sup><a href="#fn31" name="rfn31">[31]</a></sup> <a
name="Page_15"></a>such as Charles Brandon, George Boleyn, Francis Bryan,
Nicholas Carew, or Henry Fitzroy. With any ambassador went a bevy of young
gentlemen, who on their return diffused a certain mysterious sophistication
which was the envy of home-keeping youth. According to Hall, when they came
back to England they were "all French in eating and drinking and apparel,
yea, and in the French vices and brags: so that all the estates of England
were by them laughed at, the ladies and gentlewomen were dispraised, and
nothing by them was praised, but if it were after the French turn."<sup><a
href="#fn32" name="rfn32">[32]</a></sup> From this time on young courtiers
pressed into the train of an ambassador in order to see the world and
become like Ann Boleyn's captivating brother, or Elizabeth's favourite, the
Earl of Oxford, or whatever gallant was conspicuous at court for foreign
graces.</p>

<p>There was still another contributory element to the growth of travel,
one which touched diplomats, scholars, and courtiers--the necessity of
learning modern languages. By the middle of the sixteenth century Latin was
no longer sufficient for intercourse between educated people. In the most
civilized countries the vernacular had been elevated to the dignity of the
classical tongues by being made the literary vehicle of such poets as
Politian <a name="Page_16"></a>and Bembo, Ronsard and Du Bellay. A
vernacular literature of great beauty, too important to be overlooked,
began to spring up on all sides. One could no longer keep abreast of the
best thought without a knowledge of modern languages. More powerful than
any academic leanings was the Renaissance curiosity about man, which could
not be satisfied through the knowledge of Latin only. Hardly anyone but
churchmen talked Latin in familiar conversation with one. When a man
visited foreign courts and wished to enter into social intercourse with
ladies and fashionables, or move freely among soldiers, or settle a bill
with an innkeeper, he found that he sorely needed the language of the
country. So by the time we reach the reign of Edward VI., we find Thomas
Hoby, a typical young gentleman of the period, making in his diary entries
such as these: "Removed to the middes of Italy, to have a better knowledge
of ye tongue and to see Tuscany." "Went to Sicily both to have a sight of
the country and also to absent myself for a while out of Englishmenne's
companie for the tung's sake."<sup><a href="#fn33"
name="rfn33">[33]</a></sup> Roger Ascham a year or two later writes from
Germany that one of the chief advantages of being at a foreign court was
the ease with which <a name="Page_17"></a>one learned German, French, and
Italian, whether he would or not. "I am almost an Italian myself and never
looks on it." He went so far as to say that such advantages were worth ten
fellowships at St John's.<sup><a href="#fn34"
name="rfn34">[34]</a></sup></p>

/></a><br />EDWARD DE VERE, SEVENTEENTH EARL OF OXFORD <i>From an
engraving by J. Brown after G.P. Harding.</i> This favourite of Queen
Elizabeth introduced many Italian fashions to her Court.</p>

<p>We have noted how Italy came to be the lode-stone of scholars, and how
courtiers sought the grace which France bestowed, but we have not yet
accounted for the attraction of Germany. Germany, as a centre of travel,
was especially popular in the reign of Edward the Sixth. France went
temporarily out of fashion with those men of whom we have most record. For
in Edward's reign the temper of the leading spirits in England was notably
at variance with the court of France. It was to Germany that Edward's
circle of Protestant politicians, schoolmasters, and chaplains felt most
drawn--to the country where the tides of the Reformation were running high,
and men were in a ferment over things of the spirit; to the country of
Sturm and Bucer, and Fagius and Ursinus--the doctrinalists and educators so
revered by Cambridge. Cranmer, who gathered under his roof as many German
savants as could survive in the climate of England,<sup><a href="#fn35"
name="rfn35">[35]</a></sup> kept the <a name="Page_18"></a>current of
understanding and sympathy flowing between Cambridge and Germany, and since
Cambridge, not Oxford, dominated the scholarly and political world of
Edward the Sixth, from that time on Germany, in the minds of the St John's
men, such as Burleigh, Ascham and Hoby, was the place where one might meet
the best learned of the day.</p>

<p>We have perhaps said enough to indicate roughly the sources of the
Renaissance fashion for travel which gave rise to the essays we are about
to discuss. The scholar's desire to specialize at a foreign university, in
Greek, in medicine, or in law; the courtier's ambition to acquire modern
languages, study foreign governments, and generally fit himself for the
service of the State, were dignified aims which in men of character
produced very happy results. It was natural that others should follow their
example. In Elizabethan times the vogue of travelling to become a "compleat
person" was fully established. And though in mean and trivial men the ideal
took on such odd shapes and produced such dubious results that in every
generation there were critics who questioned the benefits of travel, the
ideal persisted. There was always something, certainly, to be <a
name="Page_19"></a>learned abroad, for men of every calibre. Those who did
not profit by the study of international law learned new tricks of the
rapier. And because experience of foreign countries was expensive and hard
to come at, the acquirement of it gave prestige to a young man.</p>

<p>Besides, underneath worldly ambition was the old curiosity to see the
world and know all sorts of men--to be tried and tested. More powerful than
any theory of education was the yearning for far-off, foreign things, and
the magic of the sea.</p>

<a name="Page_20"></a><h2><a name='CHAPTER_II'></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE HIGH PURPOSE OF THE ELIZABETHAN TRAVELLER</h3>


<p>The love of travel, we all know, flourished exceedingly in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. All classes felt the desire to go beyond seas upon</p>

<blockquote>
"Such wind as scatters young men through the world,<br />
To seeke their fortunes farther than at home,<br />
Where small experience growes."<sup><a href="#fn36"
name="rfn36">[36]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>The explorer and the poet, the adventurer, the prodigal and the earl's
son, longed alike for foreign shores. What Ben Jonson said of Coryat might
be stretched to describe the average Elizabethan: "The mere superscription
of a letter from Zurich sets him up like a top: Basil or Heidelberg makes
him spinne. And at seeing the word Frankford, or Venice, though but in the
title of a Booke, he is readie to breake doublet, cracke elbowes, and
overflowe the roome with his murmure."<sup><a href="#fn37"
name="rfn37">[37]</a></sup> Happy was an obscure gentleman like Fynes
Moryson, who could roam for ten years through the "twelve Dominions of
Germany, Bohmerland, Sweitzerand, Netherland, Denmarke, Poland, Italy, <a
name="Page_21"></a>Turkey, France, England, Scotland and Ireland" and not
be peremptorily called home by his sovereign. Sad it was to be a court
favourite like Fulke Greville, who four times, thirsting for strange lands,
was plucked back to England by Elizabeth.</p>

<p>At about the time (1575) when some of the most prominent
courtiers--Edward Dyer, Gilbert Talbot, the Earl of Hertford, and more
especially Sir Christopher Hatton and Sir Philip Sidney--had just returned
from abroad, book-publishers thought it worth while to print books
addressed to travellers. At least, there grew up a demand for advice to
young men which became a feature of Elizabethan literature, printed and
unprinted. It was the convention for a young man about to travel to apply
to some experienced or elderly friend, and for that friend to disburden a
torrent of maxims after the manner of Polonius. John Florio, who knew the
humours of his day, represents this in a dialogue in <i>Second
Frutes</i>.<sup><a href="#fn38" name="rfn38">[38]</a></sup> So does Robert
Greene in <i>Greene's Mourning Garment</i>.<sup><a href="#fn39"
name="rfn39">[39]</a></sup> What were at first the personal warnings of a
wise man to his young friend, such as Cecil's <a name="Page_22"></a>letter
to Rutland, grew into a generalized oration for the use of any traveller.
Hence arose manuals of instruction--marvellous little books, full of
incitements to travel as the duty of man, summaries of the leading
characteristics of foreigners, directions for the care of sore feet--and a
strange medley of matters.</p>

<p>Among the first essays of this sort are translations from Germanic
writers, with whom, if Turler is right, the book of precepts for travel
originated. For the Germans, with the English, were the most indefatigable
travellers of all nations. Like the English, they suddenly woke up with a
start to the idea that they were barbarians on the outskirts of
civilization, and like Chicago of the present day, sent their young men
"hustling for culture." They took up assiduously not only the Renaissance
ideal of travel as a highly educating experience, by which one was made a
complete man intellectually, but also the Renaissance conviction that
travel was a duty to the State. Since both Germany and England were
somewhat removed from the older and more civilized nations, it was
necessary for them to make an effort to learn what was going on at the
centre of the world. It was therefore the duty of gentlemen, especially of
noblemen, to whom the State would look to be directed, to search out the
marts of <a name="Page_23"></a>learning, frequent foreign courts, and by
knowing men and languages be able to advise their prince at home, after the
manner set forth in <i>Il Cortegiano</i>. It must be remembered that in the
sixteenth century there were no schools of political economy, of modern
history or modern languages at the universities. A sound knowledge of these
things had to be obtained by first-hand observation. From this fact arose
the importance of improving one's opportunities, and the necessity for
methodical, thorough inquiry, which we shall find so insisted upon in these
manuals of advice.</p>

<p>Hieronymus Turlerus claims that his <i>De Peregrinatione</i>
(Argentorati, 1574) is the first book to be devoted to precepts of travel.
It was translated into English and published in London in 1575, under the
title of <i>The Traveiler of Jerome Turler</i>, and is, as far as I know,
the first book of the sort in England. Not much is known of Turler, save
that he was born at Leissnig, in Saxony, in 1550, studied at Padua, became
a Doctor of Law, made such extensive travels that he included even
England--a rare thing in those days--and after serving as Burgomaster in
his native place, died in 1602. His writings, other than <i>De
Peregrinatione</i>, are three translations from Machiavelli.<sup><a
href="#fn40" name="rfn40">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_24"></a>Turler addresses to two young German noblemen his
book "written on behalf of such as are desirous to travell, and to see
foreine cuntries, and specially of students.... Mee thinkes they do a good
deede, and well deserve of al men, that give precepts for traveyl. Which
thing, althoughe I perceive that some have done, yet have they done it here
and there in sundrie Bookes and not in any one certeine place." A
discussion of the advantages of travel had appeared in Thomas Wilson's
<i>Arte of Rhetorique</i> (1553),<sup><a href="#fn41"
name="rfn41">[41]</a></sup> and certain practical directions for avoiding
ailments to which travellers were susceptible had been printed in Basel in
1561,<sup><a href="#fn42" name="rfn42">[42]</a></sup> but Turler's would
seem to be the first book devoted to the praise of peregrination. Not only
does Turler say so himself, but Theodor Zwinger, who three years later
wrote <i>Methodus Apodemica</i>, declares that Turler and Pyrckmair were
his only predecessors in this sort of composition.<sup><a href="#fn43"
name="rfn43">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pyrckmair was apparently one of those governors, or Hofmeister,<sup><a
href="#fn44" name="rfn44">[44]</a></sup> who accompanied young <a
name="Page_25"></a>German noblemen on their tours through Europe. He drew
up a few directions, he declares, as guidance for himself and the Count von
Sultz, whom he expected shortly to guide into Italy. He had made a previous
journey to Rome, which he enjoyed with the twofold enthusiasm of the
humanist and the Roman Catholic, beholding "in a stupor of admiration" the
magnificent remnants of classic civilization and the institutions of a
benevolent Pope.<sup><a href="#fn45" name="rfn45">[45]</a></sup></p>

<p>From Plantin's shop in Antwerp came in 1587 a narrative by another
Hofmeister--Stephen Vinandus Pighius--concerning the life and travels of
his princely charge, Charles Frederick, Duke of Cleves, who on his grand
tour died in Rome. Pighius discusses at considerable length,<sup><a
href="#fn46" name="rfn46">[46]</a></sup> in describing the hesitancy of the
Duke's guardians about sending him on a tour, the advantages and
disadvantages of travel. The expense of it and the diseases you catch, were
great deterrents; yet the widening of the mind which judicious travelling
insures, so greatly outweighed these and other disadvantages, that it was
arranged after much <a name="Page_26"></a>discussion, "not only in the
Council but also in the market-place and at the dinner-table," to send
young Charles for two years to Austria to the court of his uncle the
Emperor Maximilian, and then to Italy, France, and Lower Germany to visit
the princess, his relations, and friends, and to see life.</p>

<p>Theodor Zwinger, who was reputed to be the first to reduce the art of
travel into a form and give it the appearance of a science,<sup><a
href="#fn47" name="rfn47">[47]</a></sup> died a Doctor of Medicine at
Basel. He had no liking for his father's trade of furrier, but apprenticed
himself for three years to a printer at Lyons. Somehow he managed to learn
some philosophy from Peter Ramus at Paris, and then studied medicine at
Padua, where he met Jerome Turler.<sup><a href="#fn48"
name="rfn48">[48]</a></sup> As Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine he
occupied several successive professorships at Basel.</p>

<p>Even more distinguished in the academic world was the next to carry on
the discussion of travel--Justus Lipsius. His elegant letter on the
subject,<sup><a href="#fn49" name="rfn49">[49]</a></sup> written a year
after Zwinger's book was published, was translated into English by Sir John
Stradling in 1592.<sup><a href="#fn50" name="rfn50">[50]</a></sup>
Stradling, however, <a name="Page_27"></a>has so enlarged the original by
whatever fancies of his own occurred to him, that it is almost a new
composition. Philip Jones took no such liberties with the "Method" of
Albert Meier, which he translated two years after it was published in
1587.<sup><a href="#fn51" name="rfn51">[51]</a></sup> In his dedication to
Sir Francis Drake of "this small but sweete booke of Method for men
intending their profit and honor by the experience of the world," Jones
declares that he first meant it only to benefit himself, "when pleasure of
God, convenient time and good company" should draw him to travel.</p>

<p>The <i>Pervigilium Mercurii</i> of Georgius Loysius, a friend of
Scaliger, was never translated into English, but the important virtues of a
traveller therein described had their influence on English readers. Loysius
compiled two hundred short petty maxims, illustrated by apt classical
quotations, bearing on the correct behaviour and duties of a traveller. For
instance, he must avoid luxury, as says Seneca; and laziness, as say Horace
and Ovid; he must be reticent about his wealth and learning and keep his
counsel, like Ulysses. He must observe the morals and religion of others,
but not criticise them, for different nations have different <a
name="Page_28"></a>religions, and think that their fathers' gods ought to
be served diligently. He that disregards these things acts with pious zeal
but without consideration for other people's feelings ("nulla ratione
cujusque vocationis").<sup><a href="#fn52" name="rfn52">[52]</a></sup>
James Howell may have read maxim 99 on how to take jokes and how to make
them, "joci sine vilitate, risus sine cachinno, vox sine clamore" (let your
jokes be free from vulgarity, your laugh not a guffaw, and your voice not a
roar).</p>

<p>Loysius reflects the sentiment of his country in his conviction that
"Nature herself desires that women should stay at home." "It is true
throughout the whole of Germany that no woman unless she is desperately
poor or 'rather fast' desires to travel."<sup><a href="#fn53"
name="rfn53">[53]</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding to these earliest essays the <i>Oration in Praise of Travel</i>,
by Hermann Kirchner,<sup><a href="#fn54" name="rfn54">[54]</a></sup> we
have a group of instructions sprung from German soil all characterized by
an exalted mood and soaring <a name="Page_29"></a>style. They have in
common the tendency to rationalize the activities of man, which was so
marked a feature of the Renaissance. The simple errant impulse that Chaucer
noted as belonging with the songs of birds and coming of spring, is
dignified into a philosophy of travel.</p>

<p>Travel, according to our authors, is one of the best ways to gain
personal force, social effectiveness--in short, that mysterious "virtù" by
which the Renaissance set such great store. It had the negative value of
providing artificial trials for young gentlemen with patrimony and no
occupation who might otherwise be living idly on their country estates, or
dissolutely in London. Knight-errantry, in chivalric society, had provided
the hardships and discipline agreeable to youth; travel "for vertues sake,
to apply the study of good artes,"<sup><a href="#fn55"
name="rfn55">[55]</a></sup> was in the Renaissance an excellent way to keep
a young man profitably busy. For besides the academic advantages of foreign
universities, travel corrected the character. The rude and arrogant young
nobleman who had never before left his own country, met salutary opposition
and contempt from strangers, and thereby gained modesty. By observing the
refinements of the older nations, his uncouthness was softened: the rough
barbarian cub was gradually mollified <a name="Page_30"></a>into the civil
courtier. And as for giving one prudence and patience, never was such a
mentor as travel. The tender, the effeminate, the cowardly, were hardened
by contention with unwonted cold or rain or sun, with hard seats, stony
pillows, thieves, and highwaymen. Any simple, improvident, and foolish
youth would be stirred up to vigilancy by a few experiences with "the
subtelty of spies, the wonderful cunning of Inn-keepers and baudes and the
great danger of his life."<sup><a href="#fn56" name="rfn56">[56]</a></sup>
In short, the perils and discomforts of travel made a mild prelude to the
real life into which a young man must presently fight his way. Only
experience could teach him how to be cunning, wary, and bold; how he might
hold his own, at court or at sea, among Elizabeth's adventurers.</p>

<p>However, this development of the individual was only part of the benefit
of travel. Far more to be extolled was his increased usefulness to the
State. That was the stoutest reason for leaving one's "owne sweete country
dwellings" to endure hardships and dangers beyond seas. For a traveller may
be of the greatest benefit to his own country by being able to compare its
social, economic, and military arrangements with those of other
commonwealths. He is wisely warned, <a name="Page_31"></a>therefore,
against that fond preference for his own country which leads him to close
his eyes to any improvement--"without just cause preferring his native
country,"<sup><a href="#fn57" name="rfn57">[57]</a></sup> but to use choice
and discretion, to see, learn, and diligently mark what in every place is
worthy of praise and what ought to be amended, in magistrates, regal
courts, schools, churches, armies--all the ways and means pertaining to
civil life and the governing of a humane society. For all improvement in
society, say our authors, came by travellers bringing home fresh ideas.
Examples from the ancients, to complete a Renaissance argument, are cited
to prove this.<sup><a href="#fn58" name="rfn58">[58]</a></sup> So the
Romans sent their children to Marseilles, so Cyrus travelled, though yet
but a child, so Plato "purchased the greatest part of his divine wisdome
from the very innermost closets of Egypt." Therefore to learn how to serve
one's Prince in peace or war, as a soldier, ambassador, or "politicke
person," one must, like Ulysses, have known many men and seen many cities;
know not only the objective points of foreign countries, such as the
fortifications, the fordable rivers, the distances between places, but the
more subjective characteristics, such as the "chief force and virtue of the
Spanyardes and of <a name="Page_32"></a>the Frenchmen. What is the greatest
vice in both nacions? After what manner the subjects in both countries
shewe their obedience to their prince, or oppose themselves against
him?"<sup><a href="#fn59" name="rfn59">[59]</a></sup> Here we see coming
into play the newly acquired knowledge of human nature of which the
sixteenth century was so proud. An ambassador to Paris must know what was
especially pleasing to a Frenchman. Even a captain in war must know the
special virtues and vices of the enemy: which nation is ablest to make a
sudden sally, which is stouter to entertain the shock in open field, which
is subtlest of the contriving of an ambush.</p>

<p>Evidently, since there is so varied a need for acquaintance with foreign
countries, travel is a positive duty. Noah, Aristotle, Solomon, Julius
C&aelig;sar, Columbus, and many other people of authority are quoted to
prove that "all that ever were of any great knowledge, learning or wisdom
since the beginning of the world unto this present, have given themselves
to travel: and that there never was man that performed any great thing or
achieved any notable exploit, unless he had travelled."<sup><a href="#fn60"
name="rfn60">[60]</a></sup></p>

<p>This summary, of course, cannot reproduce the style of each of our
authors, and only roughly <a name="Page_33"></a>indicates their method of
persuasion. Especially it cannot represent the mode of Zwinger, whose
contribution is a treatise of four hundred pages, arranged in outline form,
by means of which any single idea is made to wend its tortuous way through
folios. Every aspect of the subject is divided and subdivided with
meticulous care. He cannot speak of the time for travel without
discriminating between natural time, such as years and days, and artificial
time, such as festivals and holidays; nor of the means of locomotion
without specifying the possibility of being carried through the air by: (I)
Mechanical means, such as the wings of Icarus; or (2) Angels, as the
Apostle Philip was snatched from Samaria.<sup><a href="#fn61"
name="rfn61">[61]</a></sup> In this elaborate method he found an imitator
in Sir Thomas Palmer.<sup><a href="#fn62" name="rfn62">[62]</a></sup> The
following, a mere truncated fragment, may serve to illustrate both
books:--</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the idea of travel as a duty to the State had permeated the
Elizabethans from the courtier to the common sailor is borne out by
contemporary <a name="Page_35"></a>letters of all sorts. Even William
Bourne, an innkeeper at Gravesend, who wrote a hand-book of applied
mathematics, called it <i>The Treasure for Travellers</i><sup><a
href="#fn63" name="rfn63">[63]</a></sup> and prefaced it with an
exhortation in the style of Turler. In the correspondence of Lord Burghley,
Sir Philip Sidney, Fulke Greville, the Earl of Essex, and Secretary
Davison, we see how seriously the aim of travel was inculcated. Here are
the same reminders to have the welfare of the commonwealth constantly in
mind, to waste no time, to use order and method in observation, and to
bring home, if possible, valuable information. Sidney bewails how much he
has missed for "want of having directed my course to the right end, and by
the right means." But he trusts his brother has imprinted on his mind "the
scope and mark you mean by your pains to shoot at. Your purpose is, being a
gentleman born, to furnish yourself with the knowledge of such things as
may be serviceable to your country."<sup><a href="#fn64"
name="rfn64">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p>Davison urges the value of experience, scorning the man who thinks to
fit himself by books: "Our sedentary traveller may pass for a wise man as
long as he converseth either with dead men by reading, or by writing, with
men absent. But <a name="Page_36"></a>let him once enter on the stage of
public employment, and he will soon find, if he can but be sensible of
contempt, that he is unfit for action. For ability to treat with men of
several humours, factions and countries; duly to comply with them, or stand
off, as occasion shall require, is not gotten only by reading of books, but
rather by studying of men: yet this is ever held true. The best scholar is
fittest for a traveller, as being able to make the most useful
observations: experience added to learning makes a perfect man."<sup><a
href="#fn65" name="rfn65">[65]</a></sup></p>

<p>Both Essex and Fulke Greville are full of warnings against superficial
and showy knowledge of foreign countries: "The true end of knowledge is
clearness and strength of judgment, and not ostentation, or ability to
discourse, which I do rather put your Lordship in mind of, because the most
part of noblemen and gentlemen of our time have no other use nor end of
their learning but their table-talk. But God knoweth they have gotten
little that have only this discoursing gift: for, though like empty vessels
they sound loud when a man knocks upon their outsides, yet if you pierce
into them, you shall find that they are full of nothing but wind."<sup><a
href="#fn66" name="rfn66">[66]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_37"></a>Lord Burghley, wasting not a breath, tersely
instructs the Earl of Rutland in things worthy of observation. Among these
are frontier towns, with what size garrison they are maintained, etc.; what
noblemen live in each province, by what trade each city is supported. At
Court, what are the natural dispositions of the king and his brothers and
sisters, what is the king's diet, etc. "Particularly for yourself, being a
nobleman, how noblemen do keep their wives, their children, their estates;
how they provide for their younger children; how they keep the household
for diet," and so on.<sup><a href="#fn67" name="rfn67">[67]</a></sup></p>

<p>So much for the attitude of the first "Subsidium Peregrinantibus." It
will be seen that it was something of a trial and an opportunity to be a
traveller in Elizabethan times. But biography is not lacking in evidence
that the recipients of these directions did take their travels seriously
and try to make them profitable to the commonwealth. Among the Rutland
papers<sup><a href="#fn68" name="rfn68">[68]</a></sup> is a plan of
fortifications and some notes made by the Edward Manners to whom Cecil
wrote the above letter of advice. Sir Thomas Bodley tells how full he was
of patriotic intent: "I waxed desirous to travel beyond the seas, for
attaining <a name="Page_38"></a>to the knowledge of some special modern
tongues, and for the increase of my experience in the managing of affairs,
being wholly then addicted to employ myself, and all my cares, in the
public service of the state."<sup><a href="#fn69"
name="rfn69">[69]</a></sup> Assurances of their object in travelling are
written from abroad by Sir John Harington and the third Earl of Essex to
their friend Prince Henry. Essex says: "Being now entered into my travels,
and intending the end thereof to attain to true knowledge and to better my
experience, I hope God will so bless me in my endeavours, that I shall
return an acceptable servant unto your Highness."<sup><a href="#fn70"
name="rfn70">[70]</a></sup> And Harington in the same vein hopes that by
his travels and experience in foreign countries he shall sometime or other
be more fit to carry out the commands of his Highness.<sup><a href="#fn71"
name="rfn71">[71]</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the particular ways of serving one's country was the writing of
"Observations on his Travels." This was the first exercise of a young man
who aspired to be a "politicke person." Harington promises to send to
Prince Henry whatever notes he can make of various countries. Henry Wotton
offers Lord Zouche "A View of all the present Almagne princes."<sup><a
href="#fn72" name="rfn72">[72]</a></sup> The keeping <a
name="Page_39"></a>of a journal is insisted upon in almost all the
"Directions." "It is good," says Lord Burghley to Edward Manners, "that you
make a booke of paper wherein you may dayly or at least weekly insert all
things occurent to you,"<sup><a href="#fn73" name="rfn73">[73]</a></sup>
the reason being that such observations, when contemporary history was
scarce, were of value. They were also a guarantee that the tourist had been
virtuously employed. The Earl of Salisbury writes severely to his son
abroad:</p>

<p class="figure"> <a name="etr003"><img width="80%"
alt="Illustration: FRANCIS MANNERS, SIXTH EARL OF RUTLAND Abroad in 1598."
src="images/etr003.png" /></a><br /> FRANCIS
MANNERS, SIXTH EARL OF RUTLAND Abroad in 1598. One of a family of
Elizabethan travellers. Edward, third Earl of Rutland, received a letter of
instruction from Lord Burleigh concerning what to observe in France in
1570. Roger, fifth Earl of Rutland, was directed by Bacon as to his travels
in 1596.</p>

<p>"I find every week, in the Prince's hand, a letter from Sir John
Harington, full of the news of the place where he is, and the countries as
he passeth, and all occurents: which is an argument, that he doth read and
observe such things as are remarkable."</p>

<p>This narrative was one of the chief burdens of a traveller. Gilbert
Talbot is no sooner landed in Padua than he must write to his impatient
parents and excuse himself for the lack of that "Relation." "We fulfil your
honour's commaundement in wrytynge the discourse of our travayle which we
would have sent with thes letres but it could not be caryed so conveniently
with them, as it may be with the next letres we wryte."<sup><a href="#fn74"
name="rfn74">[74]</a></sup> Francis Davison, the Secretary's son, <a
name="Page_40"></a>could not get on, somehow, with his "Relation of
Tuscany." He had been ill, he writes at first; his tutor says that the diet
of Italy--"roots, salads, cheese and such like cheap dishes"--"Mr Francis
can in no wise digest," and after that, he is too worried by poverty. In
reply to his father's complaints of his extravagance, he declares: "My
promised relation of Tuscany your last letter hath so dashed, as I am
resolved not to proceed withal."<sup><a href="#fn75"
name="rfn75">[75]</a></sup> The journal of Richard Smith, Gentleman, who
accompanied Sir Edward Unton into Italy in 1563, shows how even an ordinary
man, not inclined to writing, conscientiously tried to note the
fortifications and fertility of each province, whether it was "marvellous
barren" or "stood chiefly upon vines"; the principal commodities, and the
nature of the inhabitants: "The people (on the Rhine) are very paynefull
and not so paynefull as rude and sluttyshe." "They are well faced women in
most places of this land, and as ill-bodied."<sup><a href="#fn76"
name="rfn76">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>Besides writing his observations, the traveller laboured earnestly at
modern languages. Many and severe were the letters Cecil wrote to his son
Thomas in Paris on the subject of settling to his French. For Thomas's
tutor had difficulties in <a name="Page_41"></a>keeping his pupil from
dog-fights, horses and worse amusements in company of the Earl of Hertford,
who was a great hindrance to Thomas's progress in the language.<sup><a
href="#fn77" name="rfn77">[77]</a></sup> Francis Davison hints that his
tour was by no means a pleasure trip, what with studying Italian, reading
history and policy, observing and writing his "Relation." Indeed, as
Lipsius pointed out, it was not easy to combine the life of a traveller
with that of a scholar, "the one being of necessitie in continual motion,
care and business, the other naturally affecting ease, safety and
quietness,"<sup><a href="#fn78" name="rfn78">[78]</a></sup> but still, by
avoiding Englishmen, according to our "Directions," and by doggedly
conversing with the natives, one might achieve something.</p>

<p>To live in the household of a learned foreigner, as Robert Sidney did
with Sturm, or Henry Wotton with Hugo Blotz, was of course especially
desirable. For there were still, in the Elizabethans, remnants of that
ardent sociability among humanists which made Englishmen traverse dire
distances of sea and land to talk with some scholar on the Rhine--that
fraternizing spirit which made Cranmer fill Lambeth Palace with Martin
Bucers; and Bishop Gardiner, meanwhile, <a name="Page_42"></a>complain from
the Tower not only of "want of books to relieve my mind, but want of good
company--the only solace in this world."<sup><a href="#fn79"
name="rfn79">[79]</a></sup> It was still as much of a treat to see a wise
man as it was when Ascham loitered in every city through which he passed,
to hear lectures, or argue about the proper pronunciation of Greek; until
he missed his dinner, or found that his party had ridden out of
town.<sup><a href="#fn80" name="rfn80">[80]</a></sup> Advice to travellers
is full of this enthusiasm. Essex tells Rutland "your Lordship should
rather go an hundred miles to speake with one wise man, than five miles to
see a fair town." Stradling, translating Lipsius, urges the Earl of Bedford
to "shame not or disdaine not to intrude yourself into their familiarity."
"Talk with learned men, we unconsciously imitate them, even as they that
walke in the sun only for their recreation, are colored therewith and
sunburnt; or rather and better as they that staying a while in the
Apothecarie shop, til their confections be made, carrie away the smell of
the sweet spices even in their garments."<sup><a href="#fn81"
name="rfn81">[81]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are signs that the learned men were not always willing to shine
upon admiring strangers who burst in upon them. The renowned Doctor <a
name="Page_43"></a>Zacharias Ursinus at Heidelberg marked on his doorway
these words: "My friend, whoever you are, if you come here, please either
go away again, or give me some help in my studies."<sup><a href="#fn82"
name="rfn82">[82]</a></sup> Sidney foresees the difficulty his brother may
have: "How shall I get excellent men to take paines to speake with me?
Truly, in few words: either much expense or much humbleness."<sup><a
href="#fn83" name="rfn83">[83]</a></sup></p>

<p>If one had not the means to live with famous scholars, it was a good
plan to take up lodgings with an eminent bookseller. For statesmen,
advocates and other sorts of great men came to the shop, from whose talk
much could be learned. By and by some occasion would arise for insinuating
oneself into familarity and acquaintance with these personages, and
perhaps, if some one of them, "non indoctus," intended journeying to
another city, he might allow you to attach yourself to him.<sup><a
href="#fn84" name="rfn84">[84]</a></sup></p>

<p>Of course, for observation and experience, there was no place so
advantageous as the household of an ambassador, if one was fortunate enough
to win an entry there. The English Ambassador in France generally had a
burden of young gentlemen more or less under his care. Sometimes they <a
name="Page_44"></a>were lodged independently in Paris, but many belonged to
his train, and had meat and drink for themselves, their servants and their
horses, at the ambassador's expense.</p>

<p>Sir Amias Paulet's <i>Letter-Book</i> of 1577-8 testifies that an
ambassador's cares were considerably augmented by writing reports to
parents. Mr Speake is assured that "although I dwell far from Paris, yet I
am not unacquainted with your sonne's doing in Paris, and cannot commend
him enough to you as well for his diligence in study as for his honest and
quiet behaviour, and I dare assure you that you may be bold to trust him as
well for the order of his expenses, as for his government otherwise."<sup><a
href="#fn85" name="rfn85">[85]</a></sup> Mr Argall, whose brother could not
be taken into Paulet's house, has to be soothed as well as may be by a
letter.<sup><a href="#fn86" name="rfn86">[86]</a></sup> Mr Throckmorton,
after questionable behaviour, is sent home to his mother under excuse of
being bearer of a letter to England. "His mother prayeth that his coming
over may seeme to proceed of his owne request, because the Queen shall not
be offended with it." His mother "hath promised to gett him lycence to
travil into Italie." But, says Paulet, "He may not goe into Italie withoute
the companie of some honest and wyse man, and <a name="Page_45"></a>so I
have tould him, and in manie other things have dealt very playnely with
him."<sup><a href="#fn87" name="rfn87">[87]</a></sup></p>

<p>Among these troublesome charges of Paulet's was Francis Bacon. But to
his father, the Lord Keeper, Paulet writes only that all is well, and that
his son's servant is particularly honest, diligent, discreet and faithful,
and that Paulet is thankful for his "good and quiet behaviour in my
house"--a fact which appears exceptional.</p>

<p>Sir Dudley Carleton, as Ambassador to Venice, was also pursued by
ambitious fathers.<sup><a href="#fn88" name="rfn88">[88]</a></sup> Sir
Rowland Lytton Chamberlain writes to Carleton, begs only "that his son
might be in your house, and that you would a little train him and fashion
him to business. For I perceive he means to make him a statesman, and is
very well persuaded of him, ... like a very indulgent father.... If you can
do it conveniently, it will be a favour; but I know what a business it is
to have the breaking of such colts, and therefore will urge no more than
may be to your liking."<sup><a href="#fn89" name="rfn89">[89]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_46"></a>Besides gaining an apprenticeship in diplomacy,
another advantage of travelling with an ambassador was the participation in
ambassadorial immunities. It might have fared ill with Sir Philip Sidney,
in Paris at the time of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, if he had not
belonged to the household of Sir Francis Walsingham. Many other young men
not so glorious to posterity, but quite as much so to their mothers, were
saved then by the same means. When news of the massacre had reached
England, Sir Thomas Smith wrote to Walsingham: "I am glad yet that in these
tumults and bloody proscriptions you did escape, and the young gentlemen
that be there with you.... Yet we hear say that he that was sent by my Lord
Chamberlain to be schoolmaster to young Wharton, being come the day before,
was then <a name="Page_47"></a>slain. Alas! he was acquainted with nobody,
nor could be partaker of any evil dealing. How fearful and careful the
mothers and parents be here of such young gentlemen as be there, you may
easily guess by my Lady Lane, who prayeth very earnestly that her son may
be sent home with as much speed as may be."<sup><a href="#fn90"
name="rfn90">[90]</a></sup></p>

<p>The dangers of travel were of a nature to alarm mothers. As well as
Catholics, there were shipwrecks, pirates, and highway robbers. Moors and
Turks lay waiting "in a little port under the hill," to take passenger
vessels that went between Rome and Naples. "If we had come by daye as we
did by night, we had bin all taken slaves."<sup><a href="#fn91"
name="rfn91">[91]</a></sup> In dark strait ways up the sides of mountains,
or on some great heath in Prussia, one was likely to meet a horseman "well
furnyshed with daggs (pistols), who myght well be called a Swarte
Ritter--his face was as black as a devill in a playe."<sup><a href="#fn92"
name="rfn92">[92]</a></sup> Inns were death-traps. A man dared not make any
display of money for fear of being murdered in the night.<sup><a
href="#fn93" name="rfn93">[93]</a></sup> It was wiser to disguise himself
as a humble country boy <a name="Page_48"></a>and gall his feet by carrying
all his gold in his boots. Even if by these means he escaped common
desperadoes, he might easily offend the deadly University students, as did
the eldest son of Sir Julius C&aelig;sar, slain in a brawl in Padua,<sup><a
href="#fn94" name="rfn94">[94]</a></sup> or like the Admirable Crichton,
stabbed by his noble pupil in a dark street, bleed away his life in lonely
lodgings.<sup><a href="#fn95" name="rfn95">[95]</a></sup> Still more
dangerous were less romantic ills, resulting from strange diet and the
uncleanliness of inns. It was a rare treat to have a bed to oneself. More
probably the traveller was obliged to share it with a stranger of
disagreeable appearance, if not of disposition.<sup><a href="#fn96"
name="rfn96">[96]</a></sup> At German ordinaries "every travyler must syt
at the ordinary table both master and servant," so that often they were
driven to sit with such "slaves" that in the rush to get the best pieces
from the common dish in the middle of the table, "a man wold abhor to se
such fylthye hands in his dish."<sup><a href="#fn97"
name="rfn97">[97]</a></sup> Many an eager tourist lay down with small-pox
before he had seen anything of the world worth mentioning, or if he gained
home, brought a broken constitution with him. The third Lord North was ill
for life because of the immoderate <a name="Page_49"></a>quantities of hot
treacle he consumed in Italy, to avoid the plague.<sup><a href="#fn98"
name="rfn98">[98]</a></sup></p>

<p class="figure"> <a name="etr004"><img width="80%"
alt="Illustration: DUDLEY NORTH, THIRD BARON NORTH"
src="images/etr004.png"/></a><br />DUDLEY NORTH, THIRD BARON NORTH <i>From a print of an original
picture in the Collection of the Earl of Guildford</i> In 1602 he narrowly
escaped the plague in Venice by drinking immoderate doses of hot treacle,
to which he ascribed his life-long ill-health.</p>

<p>But it was not really the low material dangers of small-pox, quartain
ague, or robbers which troubled the Elizabethan. Such considerations were
beneath his heroical temper. Sir Edward Winsor, warned against the
piratical Gulf of Malta, writes: "And for that it should not be said an
Englishman to come so far to see Malta, and to have turned backe againe, I
determined rather making my sepulker of that Golfe."<sup><a href="#fn99"
name="rfn99">[99]</a></sup> It was the sort of danger that weakened
character which made people doubt the benefits of travel. So far we have
not mentioned in our description of the books addressed to travellers any
of the reminders of the trials of Ulysses, and dark warnings against the
"Siren-songs of Italy." Since they were written at the same time with the
glowing orations in praise of travel, it might be well to consider them
before we go farther.</p>

<h3>SOME CYNICAL ASPERSIONS UPON THE BENEFITS OF TRAVEL</h3>


<p>The traveller newly returned from foreign lands was a great butt for the
satirists. In Elizabethan times his bows and tremendous politeness, his
close-fitting black clothes from Venice, his French accent, his finicky
refinements, such as perfumes and pick-tooths, were highly offensive to the
plain Englishman. One was always sure of an appreciative audience if he
railed at the "disguised garments and desperate hats" of the "affectate
traveller" how; his attire spoke French or Italian, and his gait cried
"behold me!" how he spoke his own language with shame and loathing.<sup><a
href="#fn100" name="rfn100">[100]</a></sup> "You shall see a dapper Jacke,
that hath beene but over at Deepe,<sup><a href="#fn101"
name="rfn101">[101]</a></sup> wring his face round about, as a man would
stir up a mustard-pot, and talke English through the teeth, like ...
Monsieur Mingo de Moustrap."<sup><a href="#fn102"
name="rfn102">[102]</a></sup> Nash was one of the best at describing some
who had lived in France for half-a-dozen years, "and when they came home,
they have hyd a little <a name="Page_51"></a>w&eacute;erish leane face
under a broad French hat, kept a terrible coyle with the dust in the
str&eacute;ete in their long cloaks of gray paper, and spoke English
strangely. Naught else have they profited by their travell, save learnt to
distinguish of the true Burdeaux Grape, and know a cup of neate Gascoygne
wine from wine of Orleance; yea, and peradventure this also, to esteeme of
the poxe as a pimple, to weare a velvet patch on their face, and walke
melancholy with their armes folded."<sup><a href="#fn103"
name="rfn103">[103]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Frenchified traveller came in for a good share of satire, but darker
things were said of the Italianate Englishman. He was an atheist--a
creature hitherto unknown in England--who boldly laughed to scorn both
Protestant and Papist. He mocked the Pope, railed on Luther, and liked
none, but only himself.<sup><a href="#fn104" name="rfn104">[104]</a></sup>
"I care not," he said, "what you talk to me of God, so as I may have the
prince and the laws of the realm on my side."<sup><a href="#fn105"
name="rfn105">[105]</a></sup> In politics he allied himself with the
Papists, they being more of his way of living than the Puritans, but he was
faithless to all parties.<sup><a href="#fn106"
name="rfn106">[106]</a></sup> In private life he was vicious, and practised
"such villainy as is abominable to declare," for in Italy <a
name="Page_52"></a>he had served Circes, who turns men into beasts.<sup><a
href="#fn107" name="rfn107">[107]</a></sup> "But I am afraid," says Ascham,
"that over many of our travellers unto Italy do not eschew the way to
Circe's Court: but go and ryde and runne and flie thether, they make great
hast to cum to her; they make great sute to serve her: yea, I could point
out some with my finger that never had gone out of England, but onlie to
serve Circes in Italie. Vanitie and vice and any licence to ill living in
England was counted stale and rude unto them."<sup><a href="#fn108"
name="rfn108">[108]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is likely that some of these accusations were true. Italy more than
any other country charmed the Elizabethan Englishman, partly because the
climate and the people and the look of things were so unlike his own grey
home. Particularly Venice enchanted him. The sun, the sea, the comely
streets, "so clean that you can walk in a Silk Stockin and Sattin
Slippes,"<sup><a href="#fn109" name="rfn109">[109]</a></sup> the tall
palaces with marble balconies, and golden-haired women, the flagellants
flogging themselves, the mountebanks, the Turks, the stately black-gowned
gentlemen, were new and strange, and satisfied his sense of romance.
Besides, the University of Padua was still one of the greatest universities
in Europe. Students from all nations crowded to it. <a
name="Page_53"></a>William Thomas describes the "infinite resorte of all
nacions that continually is seen there. And I thinke verilie, that in one
region of all the worlde againe, are not halfe so many straungers as in
Italie; specially of gentilmen, whose resorte thither is principallie under
pretence of studie ... all kyndes of vertue maie there be learned: and
therfore are those places accordyngly furnisshed: not of suche students
alone, as moste commonly are brought up in our universitees (meane mens
children set to schole in hope to live upon hyred learnyng) but for the
more parte of noble mens sonnes, and of the best gentilmen: that studie
more for knowledge and pleasure than for curiositee or luker: ... This last
wynter living in Padoa, with diligent serche I learned, that the noumbre of
scholers there was little lesse than fiftene hundreth; whereof I dare saie,
a thousande at the lest were gentilmen."<sup><a href="#fn110"
name="rfn110">[110]</a></sup></p>

<p>The life of a student at Padua was much livelier than the monastic
seclusion of an English university. He need not attend many lectures, for,
as Thomas Hoby explains, after a scholar has been elected by the rectors,
"He is by his scholarship bound to no lectures, nor nothing elles but what
he lyst himselfe to go to."<sup><a href="#fn111"
name="rfn111">[111]</a></sup> So being a gentleman and <a
name="Page_54"></a>not a clerk, he was more likely to apply himself to
fencing or riding: For at Padua "there passeth no shrof-tide without
rennyng at the tilte, tourneiyng, fighting at the barriers and other like
feates of armes, handled and furnisshed after the best sort: the greatest
dooers wherof are scholers."<sup><a href="#fn112"
name="rfn112">[112]</a></sup></p>

<p>Then, too, the scholar diversified his labours by excursions to Venice,
in one of those passenger boats which plied daily from Padua, of which was
said "that the boat shall bee drowned, when it carries neither Monke, nor
Student, nor Curtesan.... the passengers being for the most part of these
kinds"<sup><a href="#fn113" name="rfn113">[113]</a></sup> and, as Moryson
points out, if he did not, by giving offence, receive a dagger in his ribs
from a fellow-student, he was likely to have pleasant discourse on the
way.<sup><a href="#fn114" name="rfn114">[114]</a></sup> Hoby took several
trips from Padua to Venice to see such things as the "lustie yong Duke of
Ferrandin, well accompanied with noble menn and gentlemen ... running at
the ring with faire Turks and cowrsars, being in a maskerie after the
Turkishe maner, and on foote casting of eggs into the wyndowes among the
ladies full of sweete waters and damaske Poulders," or like the Latin
Quarter students who frequent "La Morgue," went to <a
name="Page_55"></a>view the body of a gentleman slain in a feud, laid out
in state in his house--"to be seen of all men."<sup><a href="#fn115"
name="rfn115">[115]</a></sup> In the outlandish mixture of nations swarming
at Venice, a student could spend all day watching mountebanks, and bloody
street fights, and processions. In the renowned freedom of that city where
"no man marketh anothers dooynges, or meddleth with another mans
livyng,"<sup><a href="#fn116" name="rfn116">[116]</a></sup> it was no
wonder if a young man fresh from an English university and away from those
who knew him, was sometimes "enticed by lewd persons:" and, once having
lost his innocence, outdid even the students of Padua. For, as Greene says,
"as our wits be as ripe as any, so our willes are more ready than they all,
to put into effect any of their licentious abuses."<sup><a href="#fn117"
name="rfn117">[117]</a></sup> Thus arose the famous proverb, "An Englishman
Italianate is a devil incarnate."</p>

<p>Hence the warnings against Circes by even those authors most loud in
praise of travel. Lipsius bids his noble pupil beware of Italian women: "
... inter f&aelig;minas, form&aelig; conspicu&aelig;, sed lasciv&aelig; et
procaces."<sup><a href="#fn118" name="rfn118">[118]</a></sup> Turler must
acknowledge "an auntient complaint made by many that our countrymen usually
bring three thinges with them <a name="Page_56"></a>out of Italye: a
naughty conscience, an empty purse, and a weak stomache: and many times it
chaunceth so indeede." For since "youth and flourishing yeeres are most
commonly employed in traveill, which of their owne course and condicion are
inclined unto vice, and much more earnestly imbrace the same if it be
enticed thereto," ... "many a time pleasures make a man not thinke on his
returne," ... but he is caught by the songs of Mermaids, "so to returne
home with shame and shame enough."<sup><a href="#fn119"
name="rfn119">[119]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was necessary also to warn the traveller against those more harmless
sins which we have already mentioned: against an arrogant bearing on his
return to his native land, or a vanity which prompted him at all times to
show that he had been abroad, and was not like the common herd. Perhaps it
was an intellectual affectation of atheism or a cultivated taste for
Machiavelli with which he was inclined to startle his old-fashioned
countrymen. Almost the only book Sir Edward Unton seems to have brought
back with him from Venice was the <i>Historie of Nicolo Machiavelli</i>,
Venice, 1537. On the title page he has written: "Macchavelli Maxima / Qui
nescit dissimulare / nescit vivere / Vive et vivas / Edw. Unton. /"<sup><a
href="#fn120" name="rfn120">[120]</a></sup> Perhaps <a
name="Page_57"></a>it was only his display of Italian clothes--"civil,
because black, and comely because fitted to the body,"<sup><a href="#fn121"
name="rfn121">[121]</a></sup> or daintier table manners than Englishmen
used which called down upon him the ridicule of his enemies. No doubt there
was in the returned traveller a certain degree of condescension which made
him disagreeable--especially if he happened to be a proud and insolent
courtier, who attracted the Queen's notice by his sharpened wits and
novelties of discourse, or if he were a vain boy of the sort that cumbered
the streets of London with their rufflings and struttings.</p>

<p>In making surmises as to whom Ascham had in his mind's eye when he said
that he knew men who came back from Italy with "less learning and worse
manners," I guessed that one might be Arthur Hall, the first translator of
Homer into English. Hall was a promising Grecian at Cambridge, and began
his translation with Ascham's encouragement.<sup><a href="#fn122"
name="rfn122">[122]</a></sup> Between 1563 and 1568, when Ascham was
writing <i>The Scolemaster</i>, Hall, without finishing for a degree, or
completing the Homer, went to Italy. It would have irritated Ascham to have
a member of St John's throw over his task and his degree to go gadding.
Certainly Hall's <a name="Page_58"></a>after life bore out Ascham's
forebodings as to the value of foreign travel. On his return he spent a
notorious existence in London until the consequences of a tavern brawl
turned him out of Parliament. I might dwell for a moment on Hall's curious
account of this latter affair, because it is one of the few utterances we
have by an acknowledged Italianate Englishman--of a certain sort.</p>

<p>Hall, apparently, was one of those gallants who ruffled about
Elizabethan London and used</p>

<blockquote>
"To loove to play at Dice<br />
To sware his blood and hart<br />
To face it with a Ruffins look<br />
And set his Hat athwart."<sup><a href="#fn123"
name="rfn123">[123]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>The humorists throw a good deal of light on such "yong Jyntelmen." So
does Fleetwood, the Recorder of London, to whom they used to run when they
were arrested for debt, or for killing a carman, making as their only
apology, "I am a Jyntelman, and being a Jyntelman, I am not thus to be used
at a slave and a colion's hands."<sup><a href="#fn124"
name="rfn124">[124]</a></sup> Hall, writing in the third person, in the
assumed character of a friend, describes himself as "a man not wholly
unlearned, with a smacke of the knowledge of diverse tongues ... furious
when he is contraried ... as yourselfe is witnesse of <a
name="Page_59"></a>his dealings at Rome, at Florence, in the way between
that and Bollonia ... so implacable if he conceyve an injurie, as Sylla
will rather be pleased with Marius, than he with his equals, in a maner for
offences grown of tryffles.... Also spending more tyme in sportes, and
following the same, than is any way commendable, and the lesse, bycause, I
warrant you, the summes be great are dealte for." <sup><a href="#fn125"
name="rfn125">[125]</a></sup></p>

<p>This terrible person, on the 16th of December 1573, at Lothbury, in
London, at a table of twelve pence a meal, supped with some merchants and a
certain Melchisedech Mallerie. Dice were thrown on the board, and in the
course of play Mallerie "gave the lye with harde wordes in heate to one of
the players." "Hall sware (as he will not sticke to lende you an othe or
two), to throw Mallerie out at the window. Here Etna smoked, daggers were
a-drawing ... but the goodman lamented the case for the slaunder, that a
quarrel should be in his house, ... so ... the matter was ended for this
fitte."</p>

<p>But a certain Master Richard Drake, attending <a name="Page_60"></a>on
my Lord of Leicester, took pains first to warn Hall to take heed of
Mallerie at play, and then to tell Mallerie that Hall said he used "lewde
practices at cards." The next day at "Poules"<sup><a href="#fn126"
name="rfn126">[126]</a></sup> came Mallerie to Hall and "charged him very
hotly, that he had reported him to be a cousiner of folkes at Mawe." Hall,
far from showing that fury which he described as his characteristic, denied
the charge with meekness. He said he was patient because he was bound to
keep the peace for dark disturbances in the past. Mallerie said it was
because he was a coward.</p>

<p>Mallerie continued to say so for months, until before a crowd of
gentlemen at the "ordinary" of one Wormes, his taunts were so unbearable
that Hall crept up behind him and tried to stab him in the back. There was
a general scuffle, some one held down Hall, the house grew full in a moment
with Lord Zouche, gentlemen, and others, while "Mallerie with a great
shreke ranne with all speede out of the doores, up a paire of stayres, and
there aloft used most harde wordes againste Mr Hall."</p>

<p>Hall, who had cut himself--and nobody else--nursed his wound indoors for
some days, during which time friends brought word that Mallerie would
"shewe him an Italian tricke, intending <a name="Page_61"></a>thereby to do
him some secret and unlooked for mischief." Then, with "a mufle half over
his face," Hall took post-horses to his home in Lincolnshire. Business
called him, he tells the reader. There was no ground whatever for Mallerie
to say he fled in disguise.</p>

<p>After six months, he ventured to return to London and be gay again. He
dined at "James Lumelies--the son, as it is said, of old M. Dominicke, born
at Genoa, of the losse of whose nose there goes divers tales,"--and coming
by a familiar gaming-house on his way back to his lodgings, he "fell to
with the rest."</p>

<p>But there is no peace for him. In comes Mallerie--and with insufferably
haughty gait and countenance, brushes by. Hall tries a pleasant saunter
around Poules with his friend Master Woodhouse: "comes Mallerie again,
passing twice or thrice by Hall, with great lookes and extraordinary
rubbing him on the elbowes, and spurning three or four times a Spaniel of
Mr Woodhouses following his master and Master Hall." Hall mutters to his
servants, "Jesus can you not knocke the boyes head and the wall together,
sith he runnes a-bragging thus?" His three servants go out of the church by
the west door: when Mallerie stalks forth they set upon him and cut him
down the cheek.</p>

<p><a name="Page_62"></a>We will not follow the narrative through the
subsequent lawsuit brought by Mallerie against Hall's servants, the trial
presided over by Recorder Fleetwood, the death of Mallerie, who "departed
well leanyng to the olde Father of Rome, a dad whome I have heard some say
Mr Hall doth not hate" or Hall's subsequent expulsion from Parliament. This
is enough to show the sort of harmless, vain braggarts some of these
"Italianates" were, and how easily they acquired the reputation of being
desperate fellows. Mallerie's lawyer at the trial charged Hall with
"following the revenge with an Italian minde learned at Rome."</p>

<p>Among other Italianified Cambridge men whom Ascham might well have
noticed were George Acworth and William Barker. Acworth had lived abroad
during Mary's reign, studying civil law in France and Italy. When Elizabeth
came to the throne he was elected public orator of the University of
Cambridge, but through being idle, dissolute, and a drunkard, he lost all
his preferments in England.<sup><a href="#fn127"
name="rfn127">[127]</a></sup> Barker, or Bercher, who was educated at St
John's or Christ's, was abroad at the same time as Ascham, who may have met
him as Hoby did in Italy.<sup><a href="#fn128"
name="rfn128">[128]</a></sup> Barker seems to <a name="Page_63"></a>have
been an idle person--he says that after travels "my former fancye of
professenge nothinge partycularly was verye muche encreased"<sup><a
href="#fn129" name="rfn129">[129]</a></sup>--and a papistical one, for on
the accession of Mary he came home to serve the Duke of Norfolk, whose
Catholic plots he betrayed, under torture, in 1571. It was then that the
Duke bitterly dubbed him an "Italianfyd Inglyschemane," equal in
faithlessness to "a schamlesse Scote";<sup><a href="#fn130"
name="rfn130">[130]</a></sup> <i>i.e.</i> the Bishop of Ross, another
witness.</p>

<p>Edward de Vere, seventeenth Earl of Oxford, famous for his rude
behaviour to Sir Philip Sidney, whom he subsequently tried to dispatch with
hired assassins after the Italian manner,<sup><a href="#fn131"
name="rfn131">[131]</a></sup> might well have been one of the rising
generation of courtiers whom Ascham so deplored. In Ascham's lifetime he
was already a conspicuous gallant, and by 1571, at the age of twenty-two,
he was the court favourite. The friends of the Earl of Rutland, keeping him
informed of the news while he was fulfilling in Paris those heavy duties of
observation which Cecil mapped out for him, announce that "There is no man
of life and agility in every respect in Court, but the Earl of <a
name="Page_64"></a>Oxford."<sup><a href="#fn132"
name="rfn132">[132]</a></sup> And a month afterwards, "Th' Erle of
Oxenforde hath gotten hym a wyffe--or at the leste a wyffe hath caught
hym--that is Mrs Anne Cycille, whearunto the Queen hath gyven her consent,
the which hathe causyd great wypping, waling, and sorowful chere, of those
that hoped to have hade that golden daye."<sup><a href="#fn133"
name="rfn133">[133]</a></sup> Ascham did not live to see the development of
this favorite into an Italianate Englishman, but Harrison's invective
against the going of noblemen's sons into Italy coincides with the return
of the Earl from a foreign tour which seems to have been ill-spent.</p>

<p>At the very time when the Queen "delighted more in his personage and his
dancing and valiantness than any other,"<sup><a href="#fn134"
name="rfn134">[134]</a></sup> Oxford betook himself to Flanders--without
licence. Though his father-in-law Burghley had him brought back to the
indignant Elizabeth, the next year he set forth again and made for Italy.
From Siena, on January 3rd, 1574-5, he writes to ask Burghley to sell some
of his land so as to disburden him of his debts, and in reply to some
warning of Burghley's that his affairs in England need <a
name="Page_65"></a>attention, replies that since his troubles are so many
at home, he has resolved to continue his travels.<sup><a href="#fn135"
name="rfn135">[135]</a></sup> Eight months afterwards, from Italy, he begs
Burghley's influence to procure him a licence to continue his travels a
year longer, stating as his reason an exemplary wish to see more of
Germany. (In another letter also<sup><a href="#fn136"
name="rfn136">[136]</a></sup> he assures Cecil that he means to acquaint
himself with Sturmius--that educator of youth so highly approved of by
Ascham.) "As to Italy, he is glad he has seen it, but cares not ever to see
it again, unless to serve his prince or country." The reason they have not
heard from him this past summer is that his letters were sent back because
of the plague in the passage. He did not know this till his late return to
Venice. He has been grieved with a fever. The letter concludes with a
mention that he has taken up of Baptista Nigrone 500 crowns, which he
desires repaid from the sale of his lands, and a curt thanks for the news
of his wife's delivery.<sup><a href="#fn137"
name="rfn137">[137]</a></sup></p>

<p>From Paris, after an interval of six months, he declares his pleasure at
the news of his being a father, but makes no offer to return to England.
Rather he intends to go back to Venice. He <a name="Page_66"></a>"may pass
two or three months in seeing Constantinople and some part of
Greece."<sup><a href="#fn138" name="rfn138">[138]</a></sup></p>

<p>However, Burghley says, "I wrote to Pariss to hym to hasten hym
homewards," and in April 1576, he landed at Dover in an exceedingly sulky
mood. He refused to see his wife, and told Burghley he might take his
daughter into his own house again, for he was resolved "to be rid of the
cumber."<sup><a href="#fn139" name="rfn139">[139]</a></sup> He accused his
father-in-law of holding back money due to him, although Burghley states
that Oxford had in one year &pound;5700.<sup><a href="#fn140"
name="rfn140">[140]</a></sup> Considering that Robert Sidney, afterwards
Earl of Leicester, had only &pound;1OO a year for a tour abroad,<sup><a
href="#fn141" name="rfn141">[141]</a></sup> and that Sir Robert Dallington
declares &pound;200 to be quite enough for a gentleman studying in France
or Italy--including pay for a servant--and that any more would be
"superfluous and to his hurte,"<sup><a href="#fn142"
name="rfn142">[142]</a></sup> it will be seen that the Earl of Oxford had
&pound;5500 "to his hurte."</p>

<p>Certain results of his travel were pleasing to his sovereign, however.
For he was the first person to import to England "gloves, sweete bagges, a
perfumed leather Jerkin, and other <a name="Page_67"></a>pleasant
things."<sup><a href="#fn143" name="rfn143">[143]</a></sup> The Queen was
so proud of his present of a pair of perfumed gloves, trimmed with "foure
Tufts or Roses of coloured Silk" that she was "pictured with those Gloves
upon her hands, and for many yeeres after, it was called the Earle of
Oxford's perfume."<sup><a href="#fn144" name="rfn144">[144]</a></sup> His
own foreign and fashionable apparel was ridiculed by Gabriel Harvey, in the
much-quoted description of an Italianate Englishman, beginning:</p>

<blockquote>
"A little apish hat couched faste to the pate, like an oyster."<sup><a
href="#fn145" name="rfn145">[145]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>Arthur Hall and the Earl of Oxford will perhaps serve to show that many
young men pointed out as having returned the worse for their liberty to see
the world, were those who would have been very poor props to society had
they never left their native land. Weak and vain striplings of entirely
English growth escaped the comment attracted by a sinner with strange
garments and new oaths. For in those garments themselves lay an offence to
the commonwealth. I need only refer to the well-known jealousy, among
English haberdashers and milliners, of the superior craft of Continental
workmen, behind whom English weavers lagged: Henry the Eighth used to have
to wear hose cut out of pieces of <a name="Page_68"></a>cloth--on that leg
of which he was so proud--unless "by great chance there came a paire of
Spanish silke stockings from Spaine."<sup><a href="#fn146"
name="rfn146">[146]</a></sup> Knit worsted stockings were not made in
England till 1554, when an apprentice "chanced to see a pair of knit
worsted stockings in the lodging of an Italian merchant that came from
Mantua."<sup><a href="#fn147" name="rfn147">[147]</a></sup> Harrison's
description of England breathes an animosity to foreign clothes, plainly
founded on commercial jealousy: "Neither was it ever merrier in England
than when an Englishman was known abroad by his own cloth, and contented
himself at home with his fine carsey hosen, and a mean slop: his coat,
gown, and cloak of brown, blue, or puke, with some pretty furniture of
velvet or of fur, and a doublet of sad tawny, or black velvet, or other
comely silk, without such cuts and garish colours, as are worn in these
days, and never brought in but by the consent of the French, who think
themselves the gayest men when they have most diversities of rags and
change of colours about them."<sup><a href="#fn148"
name="rfn148">[148]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wrapped up with economic acrimony there was a good deal of the hearty
old English hatred of a Frenchman, or a Spaniard, or any foreigner, which
was always finding expression. Either it <a name="Page_69"></a>was the
'prentices who rioted, or some rude fellow who pulls up beside the carriage
of the Spanish ambassador, snatches the ambassador's hat off his head and
"rides away with it up the street as fast as he could, the people going on
and laughing at it,"<sup><a href="#fn149" name="rfn149">[149]</a></sup> or
it was the Smithfield officers deputed to cut swords of improper length,
who pounced upon the French ambassador because his sword was longer than
the statutes allowed. "He was in a great fury.... Her Majestie is greatly
offended with the officers, in that they wanted judgement."<sup><a
href="#fn150" name="rfn150">[150]</a></sup></p>

<p>There was also a dislike of the whole new order of things, of which the
fashion for travel was only a phase: dislike of the new courtier who
scorned to live in the country, surrounded by a huge band of family
servants, but preferred to occupy small lodgings in London, and join in the
pleasures of metropolitan life. The theatre, the gambling resorts, the
fence-schools, the bowling alleys, and above all the glamor of the streets
and the crowd were charms only beginning to assert themselves in
Elizabethan England. But the popular voice was loud against the nobles who
preferred to spend their money on such things instead of on improving their
estates, and who <a name="Page_70"></a>squandered on fine clothes what used
to be spent on roast beef for their retainers. Greene's <i>Quip for an
Upstart Courtier</i> parodies what the new and refined Englishman would
say:--</p>

<p>"The worlds are chaungde, and men are growne to more wit, and their
minds to aspire after more honourable thoughts: they were dunces in diebus
illis, they had not the true use of gentility, and therefore they lived
meanely and died obscurely: but now mennes capacities are refined. Time
hath set a new edge on gentlemen's humours and they show them as they
should be: not like gluttons as their fathers did, in chines of beefe and
almes to the poore, but in velvets, satins, cloth of gold, pearle: yea,
pearle lace, which scarce Caligula wore on his birthday."<sup><a
href="#fn151" name="rfn151">[151]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the whole, we may say that the objections to foreign travel rose from
a variety of motives. Ascham doubtless knew genuine cases of young men
spoiled by too much liberty, and there were surely many obnoxious boys who
bragged of their "foreign vices." Insular prejudice, jealousy and
conservatism, hating foreign influence, drew attention to these bad
examples. Lastly, there was another element in the protest against foreign
travel, which grew more and more strong towards the end of the reign of
Elizabeth and the beginning <a name="Page_71"></a>of James the First's, the
hatred of Italy as the stronghold of the Roman Catholic Church, and fear of
the Inquisition. Warnings against the Jesuits are a striking feature of the
next group of Instructions to Travellers.</p>

<h3>PERILS FOR PROTESTANT TRAVELLERS</h3>


<p>The quickening of animosity between Protestants and Catholics in the
last quarter of the sixteenth century had a good deal to do with the
censure of travel which we have been describing. In their fear and hatred
of the Roman Catholic countries, Englishmen viewed with alarm any
attractions, intellectual or otherwise, which the Continent had for their
sons. They had rather have them forego the advantages of a liberal
education than run the risk of falling body and soul into the hands of the
Papists. The intense, fierce patriotism which flared up to meet the Spanish
Armada almost blighted the genial impulse of travel for study's sake. It
divided the nations again, and took away the common admiration for Italy
which had made the young men of the north all rush together there. We can
no longer imagine an Englishman like Selling coming to the great Politian
at Bologna and grappling him to his heart--"arctissima sibi conjunxit
amicum familiaritate,"<sup><a href="#fn152" name="rfn152">[152]</a></sup>
as the warm humanistic phrase has it. In the seventeenth <a
name="Page_73"></a>century Politian would be a "contagious Papist," using
his charm to convert men to Romanism, and Selling would be a "true son of
the Church of England," railing at Politian for his "debauch'd and Popish
principles." The Renaissance had set men travelling to Italy as to the
flower of the world. They had scarcely started before the Reformation
called it a place of abomination. Lord Burghley, who in Elizabeth's early
days had been so bent on a foreign education for his eldest son, had
drilled him in languages and pressed him to go to Italy,<sup><a
href="#fn153" name="rfn153">[153]</a></sup> at the end of his long life
left instructions to his children: "Suffer not thy sonnes to pass the Alps,
for they shall learn nothing there but pride, blasphemy, and atheism. And
if by travel they get a few broken languages, that shall profit them
nothing more than to have one meat served on divers dishes."<sup><a
href="#fn154" name="rfn154">[154]</a></sup></p>

<p>The mother of Francis Bacon affords a good example of the Puritan
distrust of going "beyond seas." She could by no means sympathize with her
son Anthony's determination to become versed in foreign affairs, for that
led him into intimacy with Roman Catholics. All through his prolonged stay
abroad she chafed and fretted, while Anthony perversely remained in France,
gaining <a name="Page_74"></a>that acquaintance with valuable
correspondents, spies, and intelligencers which later made him one of the
greatest authorities in England on continental politics. He had a
confidential servant, a Catholic named Lawson, whom he sent over to deliver
some important secret news to Lord Burghley. Lady Bacon, in her fear lest
Lawson's company should pervert her son's religion and morals, had the man
arrested and detained in England. His anxious master sent another man to
plead with his mother for Lawson's release; but in vain. The letter of this
messenger to Anthony will serve to show the vehemence of anti-Catholic
feelings in a British matron in 1589.</p>

<p>"Upon my arrival at Godombery my Lady used me courteously until such
time I began to move her for Mr Lawson; and, to say the truth, for
yourself; being so much transported with your abode there that she let not
to say that you are a traitor to God and your country; you have undone her;
you seek her death; and when you have that you seek for, you shall have but
a hundred pounds more than you have now.</p>

<p>"She is resolved to procure Her Majesty's letter to force you to return;
and when that should be, if Her Majesty give you your right or desert, she
should clap you up in prison. She cannot abide to hear of you, as she
saith, nor of <a name="Page_75"></a>the other especially, and told me
plainly she should be the worse this month for my coming without you, and
axed me why you could not have come from thence as well as myself.</p>

<p>"She saith you are hated of all the chiefest on that side and cursed of
God in all your actions, since Mr Lawson's being with you....</p>

<p>"When you have received your provision, make your repair home again,
lest you be a means to shorten her days, for she told me the grief of mind
received daily by your stay will be her end; also saith her jewels be spent
for you, and that she borrowed the last money of seven several persons.</p>

<p>"Thus much I must confess unto you for a conclusion, that I have never
seen nor never shall see a wise Lady, an honourable woman, a mother, more
perplexed for her son's absence than I have seen that honourable dame for
yours."<sup><a href="#fn155" name="rfn155">[155]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was not only a general hatred of Roman Catholics which made staunch
Protestants anxious to detain their sons from foreign travel towards the
end of Elizabeth's reign, but a very lively and well-grounded fear of the
Inquisition and the Jesuits. When England was at war with Spain, any
Englishman caught on Spanish territory was a lawful prisoner for ransom;
and since <a name="Page_76"></a>Spanish territory meant Sicily, Naples, and
Milan, and Rome was the territory of Spain's patron, the Pope, Italy was
far from safe for Englishmen and Protestants. Even when peace with Spain
was declared, on the accession of James I., the spies of the Inquisition
were everywhere on the alert to find some slight pretext for arresting
travellers and to lure them into the dilemma of renouncing their faith, or
being imprisoned and tortured. There is a letter, for instance, to
Salisbury from one of his agents on the Continent, concerning overtures
made to him by the Pope's nuncio, to decoy some Englishman of note--young
Lord Roos or Lord Cranborne--into papal dominions, where he might be seized
and detained, in hope of procuring a release for Baldwin the Jesuit.<sup><a
href="#fn156" name="rfn156">[156]</a></sup> William Bedell, about to go to
Italy as chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton, the Ambassador to Venice, very
anxiously asks a friend what route is best to Italy. "For it is told me
that the Inquisition is in Millaine, and that if a man duck not low at
every Cross, he may be cast in prison.... Send me, I pray you, a note of
the chief towns to be passed through. I care not for seeing places, but to
go thither the shortest and safest way."<sup><a href="#fn157"
name="rfn157">[157]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_77"></a>Bedell's fears were not without reason, for the
very next year occurred the arrest of the unfortunate Mr Mole, whose case
was one of the sensations of the day. Fuller, in his <i>Church History</i>,
under the year 1607, records how--</p>

<p>"About this time Mr Molle, Governour to the Lord Ross in his travails,
began his unhappy journey beyond the Seas.... He was appointed by Thomas,
Earl of Exeter, to be Governour in Travail to his Grandchilde, the Lord
Ross, undertaking the charge with much reluctance (as a presage of ill
successe) and with a profession, and a resolution not to passe the
Alpes.</p>

<p>"But a Vagari took the Lord Ross to go to Rome, though some conceive
this notion had its root in more mischievous brains. In vain doth Mr Molle
dissuade him, grown now so wilfull, he would in some sort govern his
Governour. What should this good man doe? To leave him were to desert his
trust, to goe along with him were to endanger his own life. At last his
affections to his charge so prevailed against his judgment, that
unwillingly willing he went with him. Now, at what rate soever they rode to
Rome, the fame of their coming came thither before them; so that no sooner
had they entered their Inne, but Officers asked for Mr Molle, took and
carried him to the Inquisition-House, where <a name="Page_78"></a>he
remained a prisoner whilest the Lord Ross was daily feasted, favoured,
entertained: so that some will not stick to say, That here he changed no
Religion for a bad one."<sup><a href="#fn158"
name="rfn158">[158]</a></sup></p>

<p>No threats could persuade Mr Mole to renounce his heresy, and though
many attempts were made to exchange him for some Jesuits caught in England,
he lay for thirty years in the prison of the Inquisition, and died there,
at the age of eighty-one.</p>

<p>It was part of the policy of the Jesuits, according to Sir Henry Wotton,
to thus separate their tutors from young men, and then ply the pupils with
attentions and flattery, with a view to persuading them into the Church of
Rome. Not long after the capture of Mole, Wotton writes to Salisbury of
another case of the same sort.</p>

<p>"My Lord Wentworthe<sup><a href="#fn159" name="rfn159">[159]</a></sup>
on the 18th of May coming towards Venice ... accompanied with his
brother-in-law Mr Henry Crafts, one Edward <a name="Page_79"></a>Lichefeld,
their governor, and some two or three other English, through Bologna, as
they were there together at supper the very night of their arrival, came up
two Dominican Friars, with the sergeants of the town, and carried thence
the foresaid Lichefeld, with all his papers, into the prison of the
Inquisition where he yet remaineth.<sup><a href="#fn160"
name="rfn160">[160]</a></sup> Thus standeth this accident in the bare
circumstances thereof, not different, save only in place, from that of Mr
Mole at Rome. And doubtlessly (as we collect now upon the matter) if Sir
John Harington<sup><a href="#fn161" name="rfn161">[161]</a></sup> had
either gone the Roman Journey, or taken the ordinary way in his remove
thitherwards out of Tuscany, the like would have befallen his director
also, a gentleman of singular sufficiency;<sup><a href="#fn162"
name="rfn162">[162]</a></sup> for it appeareth a new piece of council
(infused into the Pope by his artisans the Jesuits) to separate by some
device their guides <a name="Page_80"></a>from our young noblemen (about
whom they are busiest) and afterwards to use themselves (for aught I can
yet hear) with much kindness and security, but yet with restraint (when
they come to Rome) of departing thence without leave; which form was held
both with the Lords Rosse and St Jhons, and with this Lord Wentworthe and
his brother-in-law at their being there. And we have at the present also a
like example or two in Barons of the Almaign nation of our religion, whose
governors are imprisoned, at Rome and Ferrara; so as the matter seemeth to
pass into a rule. And albeit thitherto those before named of our own be
escaped out of that Babylon (as far as I can penetrate) without any bad
impressions, yet surely it appeareth very dangerous to leave our travellers
in this contingency; especially being dispersed in the middle towns of
Italy (whither the language doth most draw them) certain nimble pleasant
wits in quality of interceptors, who deliver over to their correspondents
at Rome the dispositions of gentlemen before they arrive, and so subject
them both to attraction by argument, and attraction by humour."<sup><a

EXTON His letters during his travels in 1604 were considered exemplary</p>

<p>Wotton did not overrate the persuasiveness of the Jesuits. Lord Roos
became a papist.<sup><a href="#fn164" name="rfn164">[164]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_81"></a>Wotton's own nephew, Pickering, had been converted
in Spain, on his death-bed, although he had been, according to the Jesuit
records, "most tenacious of the corrupt religion which from his tender
youth he had imbibed."<sup><a href="#fn165" name="rfn165">[165]</a></sup>
In his travels "through the greater part of France, Italy, Spain and
Germany for the purpose of learning both the languages and the manners, an
ancient custom among northern nations, ... he conferred much upon matters
of faith with many persons, led either by inclination or curiosity, and
being a clever man would omit no opportunity of gaining
information."<sup><a href="#fn166" name="rfn166">[166]</a></sup> Through
this curiosity he made friends with Father Walpole of the Jesuit College at
Valladolid, and falling into a mortal sickness in that city, Walpole had
come to comfort him.</p>


<p>Another conversion of the same sort had been made by Father Walpole at
Valladolid, the year before. Sir Thomas Palmer came to Spain both for the
purpose of learning the language and seeing the country. "Visiting the
English College, he treated familiarly with the Fathers, and began to
entertain thoughts in his heart of the Catholic religion." While
cogitating, he was "overtaken by a sudden and mortal sickness. Therefore,
perceiving himself to be in danger of death, he set to work <a
name="Page_82"></a>to reconcile himself with the Catholic Church. Having
received all the last Sacraments he died, and was honourably interred with
Catholic rites, to the great amazement also of the English Protestants, who
in great numbers were in the city, and attended the funeral."<sup><a
href="#fn167" name="rfn167">[167]</a></sup></p>

<p>There is nothing surprising in these death-bed conversions, when we
think of the pressure brought to bear on a traveller in a strange land. As
soon as he fell sick, the host of his inn sent for a priest, and if the
invalid refused to see a ghostly comforter that fact discovered his
Protestantism. Whereupon the physician and apothecary, the very kitchen
servants, were forbidden by the priest to help him, unless he renounced his
odious Reformed Religion and accepted Confession, the Sacrament, and
Extreme Unction. If he died without these his body was not allowed in
consecrated ground, but was buried in the highway like a very dog. It is no
wonder if sometimes there was a conversion of an Englishman, lonely and
dying, with no one to cling to.<sup><a href="#fn168"
name="rfn168">[168]</a></sup></p>

<p>We must remember, also, how many reputed Protestants had only outwardly
conformed to the <a name="Page_83"></a>Church of England for worldly
reasons. They could not enter any profession or hold any public office
unless they did. But their hearts were still in the old faith, and they
counted on returning to it at the very end.<sup><a href="#fn169"
name="rfn169">[169]</a></sup> Sometimes the most sincere of Protestants in
sickness "relapsed into papistry." For the Protestant religion was new, but
the Roman Church was the Church of their fathers. In the hour of death men
turn to old affections. And so in several ways one can account for Sir
Francis Cottington, Ambassador to Spain, who fell ill, confessed himself a
Catholic; and when he recovered, once more became a Protestant.<sup><a
href="#fn170" name="rfn170">[170]</a></sup></p>

<p>The mere force of environment, according to Sir Charles Cornwallis,
Ambassador to Spain from 1605-9, was enough to change the religion of
impressionable spirits. His reports to England <a name="Page_84"></a>show a
constant struggle to keep his train of young gentlemen true to their
national Church.<sup><a href="#fn171" name="rfn171">[171]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Spanish Court was then at Valladolid, in which city flourished an
especially strong College of Jesuits. Thence Walpole, and other dangerous
persuaders, made sallies upon Cornwallis's fold. At first the Ambassador
was hopeful:--</p>

<p>"Much hath that Creswell and others of that Societie" (the Jesuits)
"bestir'd themselves here in Conference and Persuasion with the Gentlemen
that came to attend his Excellencie<sup><a href="#fn172"
name="rfn172">[172]</a></sup> and do secretly bragg of their much
prevailinge. Two of myne own Followers I have found corrupted, the one in
such sorte as he refused to come to Prayers, whom I presently discharged;
the other being an honest and sober young Gentleman, and one that denieth
not to be present both at Prayers and Preachinge, I continue still, having
good hope that I shall in time reduce him."<sup><a href="#fn173"
name="rfn173">[173]</a></sup></p>

<p>But within a month he has to report the conversion of Sir Thomas Palmer,
and within another month, the loss of even his own chaplain. "Were God
pleased that onlie young and weak ones did waver, it were more tollerable,"
he laments, "but I am put in some doubte of my Chaplaine himself." <a
name="Page_85"></a>He had given the chaplain--one Wadesworth, a good
Cambridge Protestant--leave of absence to visit the University of
Salamanca. In a week the chaplain wrote for a prolongation of his stay,
making discourse of "a strange Tempest that came upon him in the way, of
visible Fire that fell both before and behind him, of an Expectation of
present Death, and of a Vowe he made in that time of Danger." This manner
of writing, and reports from others that he has been a secret visitor to
the College of the Jesuits, make Cornwallis fear the worst. "I should think
him borne in a most unfortunate hower," he wails, "to become the occasion
of such a Scandall."<sup><a href="#fn174" name="rfn174">[174]</a></sup> But
his fears were realized. The chaplain never came back. He had turned
Romanist.</p>

<p>The reasons for the headway of Catholicism in the reign of James I. do
not concern us here. To explain the agitated mood of our Precepts for
Travellers, it is necessary only to call attention to the fact that
Protestantism was just then losing ground, through the devoted energy of
the Jesuits. Even in England, they were able to strike admiration into the
mind of youth, and to turn its ardour to their own purposes. But in Spain
and in Italy, backed by their impressive environment and surrounded by the
visible power <a name="Page_86"></a>of the Roman Church, they were much
more potent. The English Jesuits in Rome--Oxford scholars, many of
them--engaged the attentions of such of their university friends or their
countrymen who came to see Italy, offering to show them the antiquities, to
be guides and interpreters.<sup><a href="#fn175"
name="rfn175">[175]</a></sup> By some such means the traveller was lured
into the company of these winning companions, till their spiritual and
intellectual power made an indelible impression on him.<sup><a
href="#fn176" name="rfn176">[176]</a></sup></p>

<p>How much the English Government feared the influence of the Jesuits upon
young men abroad may be seen by the increasing strictness of licences for
travellers. The ordinary licence which everyone but a known merchant was
obliged to obtain from a magistrate before he could leave England, in 1595
gave permission with the condition that the traveller "do not haunte or
resorte unto the territories or dominions of any foreine prince or
potentate not being with us in league or amitie, <a name="Page_87"></a>nor
yet wittinglie kepe companie with any parson or parsons evell affected to
our State."<sup><a href="#fn177" name="rfn177">[177]</a></sup> But the
attempt to keep Englishmen out of Italy was generally fruitless, and the
proviso was too frequently disregarded. Lord Zouche grumbled exceedingly at
the limitations of his licence. "I cannot tell," he writes to Burghley in
1591, "whether I shall do well or no to touch that part of the licence
which prohibiteth me in general to travel in some countries, and
companioning divers persons.... This restraint is truly as an imprisonment,
for I know not how to carry myself; I know not whether I may pass upon the
Lords of Venis, and the Duke of Florens' territories, because I know not if
they have league with her Majesty or no."<sup><a href="#fn178"
name="rfn178">[178]</a></sup> Doubtless Bishop Hall was right when he
declared that travellers commonly neglected the cautions about the king's
enemies, and that a limited licence was only a verbal formality.<sup><a
href="#fn179" name="rfn179">[179]</a></sup> King James had occasion to
remark that "many of the Gentry, and others of Our Kingdom, under pretence
of travel for their experience, do pass the Alps, and not contenting
themselves to remain in Lombardy or Tuscany, to gain the language there, do
daily flock to <a name="Page_88"></a>Rome, out of vanity and curiosity to
see the Antiquities of that City; where falling into the company of Priests
and Jesuits ... return again into their countries, both averse to Religion
and ill-affected to Our State and Government."<sup><a href="#fn180"
name="rfn180">[180]</a></sup></p>

<p>To come to our Instructions for Travellers, as given in the reign of
James I., they abound, as we would expect, in warnings against the
Inquisition and the Jesuits. Sir Robert Dallington, in his <i>Method for
Travell</i>,<sup><a href="#fn181" name="rfn181">[181]</a></sup> gives first
place to the question of remaining steadfast in one's religion:</p>

<p>"Concerning the Traveliers religion, I teach not what it should be,
(being out of my element;) only my hopes are, he be of the religion here
established: and my advice is he be therein well settled, and that
howsoever his imagination shall be carried in the voluble Sphere of divers
men's discourses; yet his inmost thoughts like lines in a circle shall
alwaies concenter in this immoveable point, not to alter his first faith:
for that I knowe, that as all innovation is dangerous in a state; so is
this change in the little commonwealth of a man. And it is to be feared,
that he which is of one religion in his youth, and of another in his
manhood, will in his age be of neither....</p>

<p><a name="Page_89"></a>"I will instance in a Gentleman I knew abroade, of
an overt and free nature Zealously forward in the religion hee carried from
home, while he was in France, who had not bene twentie dayes in Italy, but
he was as farre gone on the contrary Byas, and since his returne is turned
againe. Now what should one say of such men but as the Philosopher saith of
a friend, 'Amicus omnium, Amicus nullorum,' A professor of both, a believer
in neither.<sup><a href="#fn182" name="rfn182">[182]</a></sup></p>

<p>"The next Caveat is, to beware how he heare anything repugnant to his
religion: for as I have tyed his tongue; so must I stop his eares, least
they be open to the smooth incantations of an insinuating seducer, or the
suttle arguments of a sophisticall adversarie. To this effect I must
precisely forbid him the fellowship or companie of one sort of people in
generall: these are the Jesuites, underminders and inveiglers of greene
wits, seducers of men in matter of faith, and subverters of men in <a
name="Page_90"></a>matters of State, making of both a bad christian, and
worse subject. These men I would have my Travueller never heare, except in
the Pulpit; for<sup><a href="#fn183" name="rfn183">[183]</a></sup> being
eloquent, they speake excellent language; and being wise, and therefore
best knowing how to speake to best purpose, they seldome or never handle
matter of controversie."</p>

<p>Our best authority in this period of travelling is Fynes Moryson, whose
<i>Precepts for Travellers</i><sup><a href="#fn184"
name="rfn184">[184]</a></sup> are particularly full. Moryson is well known
as one of the most experienced travellers of the late Elizabethan era. On a
travelling Fellowship from Peterhouse College, Cambridge, in 1591-1595 he
made a tour of Europe, when the Continent was bristling with dangers for
Englishmen. Spain and the Inquisition infected Italy and the Low Countries;
France was full of desperate marauding soldiers; Germany nourished robbers
and free-booters in every forest. It was the particular delight of Fynes
Moryson to run into all these dangers and then devise means of escaping
them. He never swerved from seeing <a name="Page_91"></a>whatever his
curiosity prompted him to, no matter how forbidden and perilous was the
venture. Disguised as a German he successfully viewed the inside of a
Spanish fort;<sup><a href="#fn185" name="rfn185">[185]</a></sup> in the
character of a Frenchman he entered the jaws of the Jesuit College at
Rome.<sup><a href="#fn186" name="rfn186">[186]</a></sup> He made his way
through German robbers by dressing as a poor Bohemian, without cloak or
sword, with his hands in his hose, and his countenance servile.<sup><a
href="#fn187" name="rfn187">[187]</a></sup> His triumphs were due not so
much to a dashing and magnificent bravery, as to a nice ingenuity. For
instance, when he was plucked bare by the French soldiers of even his inner
doublet, in which he had quilted his money, he was by no means left
penniless, for he had concealed some gold crowns in a box of "stinking
ointment" which the soldiers threw down in disgust.<sup><a href="#fn188"
name="rfn188">[188]</a></sup></p>

<p>His <i>Precepts for Travellers</i> are characteristically canny. Never
tell anyone you can swim, he advises, because in case of shipwreck "others
trusting therein take hold of you, and make you perish with them."<sup><a
href="#fn189" name="rfn189">[189]</a></sup> Upon duels and resentment of
injury in strange lands he throws cold common sense. "I advise young men to
moderate their aptnesse to quarrell, lest they perish with it. We are not
all like Amadis or Rinalldo, <a name="Page_92"></a>to incounter an hoste of
men."<sup><a href="#fn190" name="rfn190">[190]</a></sup> Very thoughtful is
this paragraph on the night's lodging:</p>

<p>"In all Innes, but especially in suspected places, let him bolt or locke
the doore of his chamber: let him take heed of his chamber fellows, and
always have his Sword by his side, or by his bed-side; let him lay his
purse under his pillow, but always foulded with his garters, or some thing
hee first useth in the morning, lest hee forget to put it up before hee goe
out of his chamber. And to the end he may leave nothing behind him in his
Innes, let the visiting of his chamber, and gathering his things together,
be the last thing he doth, before hee put his foote into the
stirrup."<sup><a href="#fn191" name="rfn191">[191]</a></sup></p>

<p>The whole of the Precepts is marked by this extensive caution. Since, as
Moryson truly remarks, travellers meet with more dangers than pleasures, it
is better to travel alone than with a friend. "In places of danger, for
difference of Religion or proclaimed warre, whosoever hath his Country-man
or friend for his companion doth much increase his danger, as well for the
confession of his companion, if they chance to be apprehended, as for other
accidents, since he shall be accomptable and drawne into danger, as well as
by his companion's words or deeds, <a name="Page_93"></a>as by his owne.
And surely there happening many dangers and crosses by the way, many are of
such intemperate affections, as they not only diminish the comfort they
should have from this consort, but even as Dogs, hurt by a stone, bite him
that is next, not him that cast the stone, so they may perhaps out of these
crosses grow to bitterness of words betweene themselves."<sup><a
href="#fn192" name="rfn192">[192]</a></sup> Instead of a companion,
therefore, let the traveller have a good book under his pillow, to beguile
the irksome solitude of Inns--"alwaies bewaring that it treat not of the
Commonwealth, the Religion thereof, or any Subject that may be dangerous to
him."<sup><a href="#fn193" name="rfn193">[193]</a></sup> Chance companions
of the road should not be trusted. Lest the traveller should become too
well known to them, let him always declare that he is going no further than
the next city. Arrived there, he may give them the slip and start with
fresh consorts.</p>

<p>Moryson himself, when forced to travel in company, chose Germans, kindly
honest gentlemen, of his own religion. He could speak German well enough to
pass as one of them, but in fear lest even a syllable might betray his
nationality to the sharp spies at the city gates, he made an agreement with
his companions that when he was forced to answer questions they should <a
name="Page_94"></a>interrupt him as soon as possible, and take the words
out of his mouth, as though in rudeness. If he were discovered they were to
say they knew him not, and flee away.<sup><a href="#fn194"
name="rfn194">[194]</a></sup></p>

<p>Moryson advised the traveller to see Rome and Naples first, because
those cities were the most dangerous. Men who stay in Padua some months,
and afterwards try Rome, may be sure that the Jesuits and priests there are
informed, not only of their coming, but of their condition and appearance
by spies in Padua. It were advisable to change one's dwelling-place often,
so to avoid the inquiries of priests. At Easter, in Rome, Moryson found the
fullest scope for his genius. A few days before Easter a priest came to his
lodgings and took the inmates' names in writing, to the end that they might
receive the Sacrament with the host's family. Moryson went from Rome on the
Tuesday before Easter, came to Siena on Good Friday, and upon Easter eve
"(pretending great business)" darted to Florence for the day. On Monday
morning he dodged to Pisa, and on the folowing, back to Siena. "Thus by
often changing places I avoyded the Priests inquiring after mee, which is
most dangerous about Easter time, when all men receive the
Sacrament."<sup><a href="#fn195" name="rfn195">[195]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_95"></a>The conception of travel one gathers from Fynes
Moryson is that of a very exciting form of sport, a sort of chase across
Europe, in which the tourist was the fox, doubling and turning and diving
into cover, while his friends in England laid three to one on his death. So
dangerous was travel at this time, that wagers on the return of venturous
gentlemen became a fashionable form of gambling.<sup><a href="#fn196"
name="rfn196">[196]</a></sup> The custom emanated from Germany, Moryson
explains, and was in England first used at Court and among "very Noble
men." Moryson himself put out &pound;100 to receive &pound;300 on his
return; but by 1595, when he contemplated a second journey, he would not
repeat the wager, because ridiculous voyages were by that time undertaken
for insurance money by bankrupts and by men of base conditions.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton was a celebrated product of foreign education in these
perilous times. As a student of political economy in 1592 he led a <a
name="Page_96"></a>precarious existence, visiting Rome with the greatest
secrecy, and in elaborate disguise. For years abroad he drank in tales of
subtlety and craft from old Italian courtiers, till he was well able to
hold his own in intrigue. By nature imaginative and ingenious, plots and
counterplots appealed to his artistic ability, and as English Ambassador to
Venice, he was never tired of inventing them himself or attributing them to
others. It was this characteristic of Jacobean politicians which Ben Jonson
satirized in Sir Politick-Would-be, who divulged his knowledge of secret
service to Peregrine in Venice. Greatly excited by the mention of a certain
priest in England, Sir Politick explains:</p>

<blockquote>
"He has received weekly intelligence<br />
Upon my knowledge, out of the Low Countries,<br />
For all parts of the world, in cabbages;<br />
And these dispensed again to ambassadors,<br />
In oranges, musk-melons, apricocks--,<br />
Lemons, pome-citrons, and such-like: sometimes<br />
In Colchester oysters, and your Selsey cockles."<sup><a href="#fn197"
name="rfn197">[197]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>Later on Sir Politick gives instructions for travellers:</p>

<blockquote>
"Some few particulars I have set down,<br />
Only for this meridian, fit to be known<br />
Of your crude traveller....<br />
First, for your garb, it must be grave and serious,<br />
Very reserv'd and lock'd; not tell a secret<br />
<a name="Page_97"></a>On any terms; not to your father: scarce<br />
A fable, but with caution: make sure choice<br />
Both of your company, and discourse; beware<br />
You never speak a truth--<br />
<b>Peregrine.</b>  How!<br />
<b>Sir P.</b>          Not to strangers,<br />
For those be they you must converse with most;<br />
Others I would not know, sir, but at distance,<br />
So as I still might be a saver in them:<br />
You shall have tricks eke passed upon you hourly.<br />
And then, for your religion, profess none,<br />
But wonder at the diversity of all."<sup><a href="#fn198"
name="rfn198">[198]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton's letter to Milton must not be left out of account of
Jacobean advice to travellers. It is brief, but very characteristic, for it
breathes the atmosphere of plots and caution. Admired for his great
experience and long sojourn abroad, in his old age, as Provost of Eton, Sir
Henry's advice was much sought after by fathers about to send their sons on
the Grand Tour. Forty-eight years after he himself set forth beyond seas,
he passed on to young John Milton "in procinct of his travels," his
favourite bit of wisdom, learned from a Roman courtier well versed in the
ways of Italy: "I pensieri stretti e il viso sciolto."<sup><a href="#fn199"
name="rfn199">[199]</a></sup> Milton did not follow this Machiavellian
precept to keep his "thoughts close and his countenance loose," as <a
name="Page_98"></a>Wotton translates it,<sup><a href="#fn200"
name="rfn200">[200]</a></sup> and was soon marked by the Inquisition; but
he was proud of being advised by Sir Henry Wotton, and boasted of the
"elegant letter" and "exceedingly useful precepts" which the Provost
bestowed on him at his departure for Italy.<sup><a href="#fn201"
name="rfn201">[201]</a></sup></p>

<p>So much for the admonitory side of instructions for travellers at the
opening of the seventeenth century. Italy, we see, was still feared as a
training-ground for "green wits." Bishop Hall succeeded Ascham in
denouncing the travel of young men who professed "to seek the glory of a
perfect breeding, and the perfection of that which we call civility."
Allowed to visit the Continent at an early age, "these lapwings, that go
from under the wing of their dam with the shell on their heads, run wild."
They hasten southwards, where in Italy they view the "proud majesty of
pompous ceremonies, wherewith the hearts of children and fools are easily
taken."<sup><a href="#fn202" name="rfn202">[202]</a></sup> To the
persuasive power of the Jesuits Hall devotes several pages, and makes an
impassioned plea to the authorities to prevent Englishmen from
travelling.</p>

<p><a name="Page_99"></a>Parents could be easily alarmed by any possibility
of their sons' conversion to Romanism. For the penalties of being a Roman
Catholic in England were enough to make an ambitious father dread recusancy
in his son. Though a gentleman or a nobleman ran no risk of being hanged,
quartered, disembowelled and subjected to such punishments as were dealt
out to active and dangerous priests, he was regarded as a traitor if he
acknowledged himself to be a Romanist. At any moment of anti-Catholic
excitement he might be arrested and clapped into prison. Drearier than
prison must have been his social isolation. For he was cut off from his
generation and had no real part in the life of England. Under the laws of
James he was denied any share in the Government, could hold no public
office, practise no profession. Neither law nor medicine, nor parliament
nor the army, nor the university, was open to him. Banished from London and
the Court, shunned by his contemporaries, he lurked in some country house,
now miserably lonely, now plagued by officers in search of priests. At
last, generally, he went abroad, and wandered out his life, an exile,
despised by his countrymen, who met him hanging on at foreign Courts; or
else he sought a monastery and was buried there. To be sure, the laws
against recusants were not uniformly enforced; <a
name="Page_100"></a>papistry in favourites and friends of the king was
winked at, and the rich noblemen, who were able to pay fines, did not
suffer much. But the fact remains that for the average gentleman to turn
Romanist generally meant to drop out of the world. "Mr Lewknor," writes
Father Gerard to Father Owen,<sup><a href="#fn203"
name="rfn203">[203]</a></sup> "growing of late to a full resolution of
entering the Society (of Jesus), and being so much known in England and in
the Court as he is, so that he could not be concealed in the English
College at Rome; and his father, as he considered, being morally sure to
lose his place,<sup><a href="#fn204" name="rfn204">[204]</a></sup> which is
worth unto him &pound;1000 a year, he therefore will come privately to
Liege, where I doubt not but to keep him wholly unknown."</p>

<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH ACADEMIES</h3>


<p>The admonitions of their elders did not keep young men from going to
Italy, but as the seventeenth century advanced the conditions they found
there made that country less attractive than France. The fact that the
average Englishman was a Protestant divided him from his compeers in Italy
and damped social intercourse. He was received courteously and formally by
the Italian princes, perhaps, for the sake of his political uncle or cousin
in England, but inner distrust and suspicion blighted any real friendship.
Unless the Englishman was one of those who had a secret, half-acknowledged
allegiance to Romanism, there could not, in the age of the Puritans, be
much comfortable affection between him and the Italians. The beautiful
youth, John Milton, as the author of excellent Latin verse, was welcomed
into the literary life of Florence, to be sure, and there were other
unusual cases, but the typical traveller of Stuart times was the young
gentleman who was sent to France to learn the graces, with a view to making
his fortune at Court, even as his widowed <a name="Page_102"></a>mother
sent George Villiers, afterwards Duke of Buckingham. The Englishmen who
travelled for "the complete polishing of their parts" continued to visit
Italy, to satisfy their curiosity, but it was rather in the mood of the
sight-seer. Only malcontents, at odds with their native land, like
Bothwell, or the Earl of Arundel, or Leicester's disinherited son, made
prolonged residence in Italy. Aspiring youth, seeking a social education,
for the most part hurried to France.</p>

<p>For it was not only a sense of being surrounded by enemies which during
the seventeenth century somewhat weakened the Englishman's allegiance to
Italy, but the increasing attractiveness of another country. By 1616 it was
said of France that "Unto no other countrie, so much as unto this, doth
swarme and flow yearly from all Christian nations, such a multitude, and
concourse of young Gentlemen, Marchants, and other sorts of men: some,
drawen from their Parentes bosoms by desire of learning; some, rare
Science, or new conceites; some by pleasure; and others allured by lucre
and gain.... But among all other Nations, there cometh not such a great
multitude to Fraunce from any Country, as doth yearely from this Isle
(England), both of Gentlemen, Students, Marchants, and others."<sup><a
href="#fn205" name="rfn205">[205]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_103"></a>Held in peace by Henry of Navarre, France began
to be a happier place than Italy for the Englishman abroad. Germany was
impossible, because of the Thirty Years' War; and Spain, for reasons which
we shall see later on, was not inviting. Though nominally Roman Catholic,
France was in fact half Protestant. Besides, the French Court was great and
gay, far outshining those of the impoverished Italian princes. It suited
the gallants of the Stuart period, who found the grave courtesy of the
Italians rather slow. Learning, for which men once had travelled into
Italy, was no longer confined there. Nor did the Cavaliers desire exact
classical learning. A knowledge of mythology, culled from French
translations, was sufficient. Accomplishments, such as riding, fencing, and
dancing, were what chiefly helped them, it appeared, to make their way at
Court or at camp. And the best instruction in these accomplishments had
shifted from Italy to France.</p>

<p>A change had come over the ideal of a gentleman--a reaction from the
Tudor enthusiasm for letters. A long time had gone by since Henry VIII.
tried to make his children as learned as Erasmus, and had the most erudite
scholars fetched from Oxford and Cambridge to direct the royal nursery. The
somewhat moderated esteem in which book-learning <a name="Page_104"></a>was
held in the household of Charles I. may be seen in a letter of the Earl of
Newcastle, governor to Prince Charles,<sup><a href="#fn206"
name="rfn206">[206]</a></sup> who writes to his pupil:</p>

<p>"I would not have you too studious, for too much contemplation spoils
action, and Virtue consists in that." The Prince's model is to be the
Bishop of Chichester, his tutor, who "hath no pedantry in him: his learning
he makes right use of, neither to trouble himself with it or his friends:
... reades men as well as books: ... is travell'd, which you shall perceive
by his wisdome and fashion more than by his relations; and in a word
strives as much discreetly to hide the scholler in him, as other men's
follies studies to shew it: and is a right gentleman."<sup><a href="#fn207"
name="rfn207">[207]</a></sup></p>

<p class="figure"> <a name="etr006"><img width="80%"
alt="Illustration: FENCING"
src="images/etr006.png" /></a><br /> FENCING An indispensable
part of an Englishman's education abroad.</p>

<p>Of pedantry, however, there never seems to have been any danger in Court
circles, either in Tudor or Stuart days. It took constant exhortations to
make the majority of noblemen's sons learn anything at all out of books.
For centuries the marks of a gentleman had been bravery, courtesy and a
good seat in the saddle, and it was not to be supposed that a sudden
fashionable enthusiasm for literature could change all that. Ascham had
declared that the Elizabethan young <a name="Page_105"></a>bloods thought
it shameful to be learned because the "Jentlemen of France" were not
so.<sup><a href="#fn208" name="rfn208">[208]</a></sup> When with the
general relaxation of high effort which appeared in so many ways at the
Court of James I., the mastery of Greek authors was no longer an ideal of
the courtier, the Jacobean gallant was hardly more intellectual than the
medi&aelig;val page. Henry Peacham, in 1623, described noblemen's flagging
faith in a university education. They sent their sons to Oxford or
Cambridge at an early age, and if the striplings did not immediately lay
hold on philosophy, declared that they had no aptitude for learning, and
removed them to a dancing school. "These young things," as he calls the
Oxford students "of twelve, thirteene, or foureteene, that have no more
care than to expect the next Carrier, and where to sup on Fridayes and
Fasting nights" find "such a disproportion betweene Aristotles Categories,
and their childish capacities, that what together with the sweetnesse of
libertie, varietie of companie, and so many kinds of recreation in towne
and fields abroad," they give over any attempt to understand "the crabbed
grounds of Arts." Whereupon, the parents, "if they perceive any wildnesse
or unstayednesse in their children, are presently in despaire, and out of
all hope of them <a name="Page_106"></a>for ever prooving Schollers, or fit
for anything else; neither consider the nature of youth, nor the effect of
time, the Physitian of all. But to mend the matter, send them either to the
Court to serve as Pages, or into France and Italy to see fashions, and mend
their manners, where they become ten times worse."<sup><a href="#fn209"
name="rfn209">[209]</a></sup></p>

<p>The influence of France would not be towards books, certainly. Brave,
gallant, and magnificent were the Gallic gentlemen; but not learned.
Reading made them positively ill: "la t&ecirc;te leur tourne de lire," as
Br&eacute;z&eacute; confessed.<sup><a href="#fn210"
name="rfn210">[210]</a></sup> Scorning an indoor sedentary life, they left
all civil offices to the bourgeoisie, and devoted themselves exclusively to
war. As the Vicomte D'Avenel has crisply put it:</p>

<p>"It would have seemed as strange to see a person of high rank the
Treasurer of France, the Controller of Finance, or the Rector of a
University, as it would be to see him a cloth-merchant or maker of
crockery.... The poorest younger son of an ancient family, who would not
disdain to engage himself as a page to a nobleman, or as a common soldier,
would have thought himself debased by accepting the post of secretary to an
ambassador."<sup><a href="#fn211" name="rfn211">[211]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_107"></a>Brute force was still considered the greatest
power in the world, even when Sully was Conseiller d'Etat, though divining
spirits like Eustache Deschamps had declared that the day would come when
serving-men would rule France by their wits, all because the noblesse would
not learn letters.<sup><a href="#fn212" name="rfn212">[212]</a></sup> In
vain the wise Bras-de-Fer warned his generation that glory and strength of
limb were of short duration, while knowledge was the only immortal
quality.<sup><a href="#fn213" name="rfn213">[213]</a></sup> As long as
parents saw that the honours at Court went to handsome horsemen, they
thought it mistaken policy to waste money on book-learning for their sons.
When a boy came from the university to Court, he found himself eclipsed by
young pages, who scarcely knew how to read, but had killed their man in a
duel, and danced to perfection.<sup><a href="#fn214"
name="rfn214">[214]</a></sup> A martial training, with physical
accomplishments, was the most effective, apparently.</p>

<p>The martial type which France evolved dazzled other nations, and it is
not surprising that under the Stuarts, who had inherited French ways, the
English Court was particularly open to French ideals. Our directions for
travellers reflect the <a name="Page_108"></a>change from the typical
Elizabethan courtier, "somewhat solemn, coy, big and dangerous of look," to
the easy manners of the cavalier. <i>A Method for Travell</i>, written
while Elizabeth was still on the throne, extols Italian conduct. "I would
rather," it says of the traveller, "he should come home Italianate than
Frenchified: I speake of both in the better sense: for the French is
stirring, bold, respectless, inconstant, suddaine: the Italian stayed,
demure, respective, grave, advised."<sup><a href="#fn215"
name="rfn215">[215]</a></sup> But <i>Instructions for Forreine Travell</i>
in 1642 urges one to imitate the French. "For the Gentry of France have a
kind of loose, becoming boldness, and forward vivacity in their
manners."<sup><a href="#fn216" name="rfn216">[216]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first writer of advice to travellers who assumes that French
accomplishments are to be a large part of the traveller's education, is Sir
Robert Dallington, whom we have already quoted. His <i>View of
France</i><sup><a href="#fn217" name="rfn217">[217]</a></sup> to which the
<i>Method for Travel</i> is prefixed, deserves a reprint, for both that and
his <i>Survey of Tuscany</i>,<sup><a href="#fn218"
name="rfn218">[218]</a></sup> though built on the regular model of the
Elizabethan traveller's "Relation," being a conscientious <a
name="Page_109"></a>account of the chief geographical, economic,
architectural, and social features of the country traversed, are more
artistic than the usual formal reports. Dallington wrote these Views in
1598, a little before the generation which modelled itself on the French
gallants, and his remarks on Frenchmen may well have served as a warning to
courtiers not to imitate the foibles, along with the admirable qualities,
of their compeers across the Channel. For instance, he is outraged by the
effusiveness of the "violent, busy-headed and impatient Frenchman," who
"showeth his lightness and inconstancie ... in nothing more than in his
familiaritie, with whom a stranger cannot so soone be off his horse, but he
will be acquainted: nor so soone in his Chamber, but the other like an Ape
will bee on his shoulder: and as suddenly and without cause ye shall love
him also. A childish humour, to be wonne with as little as an Apple and
lost with lesse than a Nut."<sup><a href="#fn219"
name="rfn219">[219]</a></sup> The King of France himself is censured for
his geniality. Dallington deems Henry of Navarre "more affable and familiar
than fits the Majesty of a great King." He might have found in current
gossip worse lapses than the two he quotes to show Henry's lack of
formality, but it is part of Dallington's worth that he writes of things at
<a name="Page_110"></a>first-hand, and gives us only what he himself saw;
how at Orleans, when the Italian commedians were to play before him, the
king himself, "came whiffling with a small wand to scowre the coast, and
make place for the rascall Players,... a thing, me thought, most derogatory
to the Majesty of a King of France."</p>

<p>"And lately at Paris (as they tell us) when the Spanish Hostages were to
be entertayned, he did Usher it in the great Chamber, as he had done here
before; and espying the Chayre not to stand well under the State, mended it
handsomely himselfe, and then set him downe to give them audience."<sup><a
href="#fn220" name="rfn220">[220]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nor can Dallington conceal his disapproval of foreign food. The sorrows
of the beef-eating Englishman among the continentals were always poignant.
Dallington is only one of the many travellers who, unable to grasp the fact
that warmer climes called for light diet, reproached the Italians
especially for their "parsimony and thin feeding." In Henry the Eighth's
time there was already a saying among the Italians, "Give the Englishman
his beef and mustard,"<sup><a href="#fn221" name="rfn221">[221]</a></sup>
while the English in turn jibed at the Italians for being "like
Nebuchadnezzar,--always picking of sallets." "Herbage," says Dallington
scornfully "is the most generall <a name="Page_111"></a>food of the Tuscan
... for every horse-load of flesh eaten, there is ten cart loades of
hearbes and rootes, which also their open Markets and private tables doe
witnesse, and whereof if one talke with them fasting, he shall have
sencible feeling."<sup><a href="#fn222" name="rfn222">[222]</a></sup> The
whole subject of diet he dismisses in his advice to a traveller as follows:
"As for his viands I feare not his surfetting; his provision is never so
great, but ye may let him loose to his allowance.... I shall not need to
tell him before what his dyet shall be, his appetite will make it better
than it is: for he shall be still kept sharpe: only of the difference of
dyets, he shall observe thus much: that of Germanie is full or rather
fulsome; that of France allowable; that of Italie tolerable; with the Dutch
he shall have much meat ill-dressed: with the French lesse, but well
handled; with the Italian neither the one nor the other."<sup><a
href="#fn223" name="rfn223">[223]</a></sup></p>

<p>Though there is much in Dallington's description of Italy and France to
repay attention, our concern is with his <i>Method for Travell</i>,<sup><a
href="#fn224" name="rfn224">[224]</a></sup> which, though more practical
than the earlier Elizabethan essays <a name="Page_112"></a>of the same
sort, opens in the usual style of exhortation:</p>

<p>"Plato, one of the day-starres of that knowledge, which then but dawning
hath since shone out in clearer brightness, thought nothing better for the
bettering our understanding then <i>Travell</i>: as well by having a
conference with the wiser sort in all sorts of learning, as by the [Greek:
Autopsia&ecirc;i]. The eye-sight of those things, which otherwise a man
cannot have but by Tradition; A Sandy foundation either in matter of
Science, or Conscience. So that a purpose to Travell, if it be not ad
voluptatem Solum, sed ad utilitatem, argueth an industrious and generous
minde. Base and vulgar spirits hover still about home: those are more noble
and divine, that imitate the Heavens, and joy in motion."</p>

<p>After a warning against Jesuits, which we have quoted, he comes at once
to definite directions for studying modern languages<sup><a href="#fn225"
name="rfn225">[225]</a></sup>--advice which though sound is hardly novel.
Continual speaking <a name="Page_113"></a>with all sorts of people,
insisting that his teacher shall not do all the talking, and avoiding his
countrymen are unchangeable rules for him who shall travel for
language.<sup><a href="#fn226" name="rfn226">[226]</a></sup> But this is
the first treatise for travellers which makes note of dancing as an
important accomplishment. "There's another exercise to be learned in
France, because there are better teachers, and the French fashion is in
most request with us, that is, of dancing. This I meane to my Traveller
that is young and meanes to follow the Court: otherwise I hold it
needelesse, and in some ridiculous."<sup><a href="#fn227"
name="rfn227">[227]</a></sup> This art was indeed essential to courtiers,
and a matter of great earnestness. Chamberlain reports that Sir Henry
Bowyer died of the violent exercise he underwent while practising
dancing.<sup><a href="#fn228" name="rfn228">[228]</a></sup> Henri III. fell
into a tearful passion and called the Grand Prieur a liar, a poltroon, and
a villain, at a ball, because the Grand Prieur was heard to <a
name="Page_114"></a>mutter "Unless you dance better, I would you had your
money again that your dancing has cost you." <sup><a href="#fn229"
name="rfn229">[229]</a></sup> James I. was particularly anxious to have his
"Babies" excel in complicated boundings. His copy of <i>Nuove Inventioni di
Balli</i><sup><a href="#fn230" name="rfn230">[230]</a></sup> may be seen in
the British Museum, with large plates illustrating how to "gettare la
gamba," that is, in the words of Chaucer, "with his legges casten to and
fro."<sup><a href="#fn231" name="rfn231">[231]</a></sup> Prince Henry was
skilful in these matters. The Spanish Ambassador reports how "The Prince of
Wales was desired by his royal parents to open the ball with a Spanish
gallarda: he acquitted himself with much grace and delicacy, introducing
some occasional leaps."<sup><a href="#fn232" name="rfn232">[232]</a></sup>
Prince Charles and Buckingham, during their stay in Spain, are earnestly
implored by their "deare Dad and Gossip" not to forget their dancing. "I
praye you, my babie, take heade of being hurt if ye runne at tilte, ... I
praye you in the meantyme keep your selfis in use of dawncing privatlie,
thogh ye showlde quhissell and sing one to <a name="Page_115"></a>another
like Jakke and Tom for faulte of better musike." <sup><a href="#fn233"

'Nuove Inventione di Baili,' an Italian book of instructions in dancing,
much prized by James I</i></p>

<p>However, Dallington is very much against the saltations of elderly
persons. "I remember a countriman of ours, well seene in artes and
language, well stricken in yeares, a mourner for his second wife, a father
of mariageable children, who with his other booke studies abroade, joyned
also the exercise of dancing: it was his hap in an honourable <i>Bal</i>
(as they call it) to take a fall, which in mine opinion was not so
disgracefull as the dancing it selfe, to a man of his stuffe."<sup><a
href="#fn234" name="rfn234">[234]</a></sup></p>

<p>Dallington would have criticized Frenchmen more severely than ever had
he known that even Sully gave way in private to a passion for dancing. At
least Tallemant des R&eacute;aux says that "every evening a valet de
chambre of the King played on the lute the dances of the day, and M. de
Sully danced all alone, in some sort of extraordinary hat--such as he
always wore in his cabinet--while his cronies applauded him, although he
was the most awkward man in the world."<sup><a href="#fn235"
name="rfn235">[235]</a></sup></p>

<p>Tennis is another courtly exercise in which Dallington urges moderation.
"This is dangerous, <a name="Page_116"></a>(if used with too much violence)
for the body; and (if followed with too much diligence,) for the purse. A
maine point of the Travellers care." He reached France when the rage for
tennis was at its height,--when there were two hundred and fifty tennis
courts in Paris,<sup><a href="#fn236" name="rfn236">[236]</a></sup>--and
"two tennis courts for every one Church through France," according to his
computation.<sup><a href="#fn237" name="rfn237">[237]</a></sup> Everyone
was at it;--nobles, artizans, women, and children. The monks had had to be
requested not to play--especially, the edict said, "not in public in their
shirts."<sup><a href="#fn238" name="rfn238">[238]</a></sup> Our Englishman,
of course, thought this enthusiasm was beyond bounds. "Ye have seene them
play Sets at Tennise in the heat of Summer and height of the day, when
others were scarcely able to stirre out of doors." Betting on the game was
the ruin of the working-man, who "spendeth that on the Holyday, at Tennis,
which hee got the whole weeke, for the keeping of his poore family. A thing
more hurtfull then our Ale-houses in England."<sup><a href="#fn239"
name="rfn239">[239]</a></sup></p>

<p>"There remains two other exercises," says the <i>Method for Travell</i>,
"of use and necessitie, to <a name="Page_117"></a>him that will returne
ably quallified for his countries service in warre, and his owne defence in
private quarrell. These are Riding and Fencing. His best place for the
first (excepting Naples) is in Florence under il Signor Rustico, the great
Dukes Cavallerizzo, and for the second (excepting Rome) is in Padua, under
il Sordo."<sup><a href="#fn240" name="rfn240">[240]</a></sup> Italy, it may
be observed, was still the best school for these accomplishments. Pluvinel
was soon to make a world-renowned riding academy in Paris, but the art of
fencing was more slowly disseminated. One was still obliged, like Captain
Bobadil, to make "long travel for knowledge, in that mystery only."<sup><a
href="#fn241" name="rfn241">[241]</a></sup> Brantome says the fencing
masters of Italy kept their secrets in their own hands, giving their
services only on the condition that you should never reveal what you had
learnt even to your dearest friends. Some instructors would never allow a
living soul in the room where they were giving lessons to a pupil. And even
then they used to keek everywhere, under the beds, and examine the wall to
see if it had any crack or hole through which a person could peer.<sup><a
href="#fn242" name="rfn242">[242]</a></sup> Dallington makes no further
remark on the subject, however, than the above, and after some <a
name="Page_118"></a>advice about money matters, which we will mention in
another connection, and a warning to the traveller that his apparel must be
in fashion--for the fashions change with trying rapidity, and the French
were very scornful of anyone who appeared in a last year's suit<sup><a
href="#fn243" name="rfn243">[243]</a></sup>--he brings to a close one of
the pithiest essays in our collection.</p>

<p>When the influence of France over the ideals of a gentleman was well
established, James Howell wrote his <i>Instructions for Forreine
Travell</i>,<sup><a href="#fn244" name="rfn244">[244]</a></sup> and in this
book for the first time the traveller is advised to stay at one of the
French academies--or riding schools, as they really were.</p>

<p>His is the best known, probably, of all our treatises, partly because it
was reprinted a little while ago by Mr Gosse, and partly because of its own
merits. Howell had an easier, more indulgent outlook upon the world than
Dallington, and could see all nations with equal humour--his own included.
Take his comparison of the Frenchman and the Spaniard.</p>

<p>The Frenchman "will dispatch the weightiest affairs as hee walke along
in the streets, or at <a name="Page_119"></a>meales, the other upon the
least occasion of businesse will retire solemnly to a room, and if a fly
chance to hum about him, it will discompose his thoughts and puzzle him: It
is a kind of sicknesse for a Frenchman to keep a secret long, and all the
drugs of Egypt cannot get it out of a Spaniard.... The Frenchman walks
fast, (as if he had a Sergeant always at his heels,) the Spaniard slowly,
as if hee were newly come out of some quartan Ague; the French go up and
down the streets confusedly in clusters, the Spaniards if they be above
three, they go two by two, as if they were going a Procession; etc.
etc."<sup><a href="#fn245" name="rfn245">[245]</a></sup></p>

<p>With the same humorous eye he observes the Englishmen returned to London
from Paris, "whom their gate and strouting, their bending in the hammes,
and shoulders, and looking upon their legs, with frisking and singing do
speake them Travellers.... Some make their return in huge monstrous
Periwigs, which is the Golden Fleece <i>they</i> bring over with them.
Such, I say, are a shame to their Country abroad, and their kinred at home,
and to their parents, Benonies, the sons of sorrow: and as Jonas in the
Whales belly, travelled much, but saw little."<sup><a href="#fn246"
name="rfn246">[246]</a></sup></p>

<p>These are some of the advantages an Englishman will reap from foreign
travel:</p>

<p><a name="Page_120"></a>"One shall learne besides there not to interrupt
one in the relation of his tale, or to feed it with odde interlocutions:
One shall learne also not to laugh at his own jest, as too many used to do,
like a Hen, which cannot lay an egge but she must cackle.</p>

<p>"Moreover, one shall learne not to ride so furiously as they do
ordinarily in England, when there is no necessity at all for it; for the
Italians have a Proverb, that a galloping horse is an open sepulcher. And
the English generally are observed by all other Nations, to ride commonly
with that speed as if they rid for a midwife, or a Physitian, or to get a
pardon to save one's life as he goeth to execution, when there is no such
thing, or any other occasion at all, which makes them call England the Hell
of Horses.</p>

<p>"In these hot Countreyes also, one shall learne to give over the habit
of an odde custome, peculiar to the English alone, and whereby they are
distinguished from other Nations, which is, to make still towards the
chimney, though it bee in the Dog-dayes."<sup><a href="#fn247"
name="rfn247">[247]</a></sup></p>

<p>We need not comment in detail upon Howell's book since it is so
accessible. The passage which chiefly marks the progress of travel for
study's sake is this:</p>

<p><a name="Page_121"></a>"For private Gentlemen and Cadets, there be
divers Academies in Paris, Colledge-like, where for 150 pistols a Yeare,
which come to about &pound;150 sterling per annum of our money, one may be
very well accomodated, with lodging and diet for himself and man, and be
taught to Ride, to Fence, to manage Armes, to Dance, Vault, and ply the
Mathematiques."<sup><a href="#fn248" name="rfn248">[248]</a></sup></p>

<p>These academies were one of the chief attractions which France had for
the gentry of England in the seventeenth century. The first one was founded
by Pluvinel, the <i>grand &eacute;cuyer</i> of Henri IV. Pluvinel,
returning from a long apprenticeship to Pignatelli in Naples, made his own
riding-school the best in the world, so that the French no longer had to
journey to Italian masters. He obtained from the king the basement of the
great gallery of the Louvre, and there taught Louis XIII. and other young
nobles of the Court--amongst them the Marquis du Chillon, afterwards
Cardinal Richelieu--to ride the great horse.<sup><a href="#fn249"
name="rfn249">[249]</a></sup> Such was the success of his man&egrave;ge
that he <a name="Page_122"></a>annexed masters to teach his pupils dancing,
vaulting, and swordsmanship, as well as drawing and mathematics, till he
had rounded out what was considered a complete education for a chevalier.
In imitation of his establishment, many other riding-masters, such as
Benjamin, Potrincourt, and Nesmond, set up others of the same sort, which
drew pupils from other nations during all the seventeenth century.<sup><a
href="#fn250" name="rfn250">[250]</a></sup> In the suburb of
Pr&eacute;-aux-clercs, says Malingre in 1640, "are several academies where
the nobility learn to ride. The most frequented is that of M. de Mesmon,
where there is a prince of Denmark and one of the princes palatine of the
Rhine, and a quantity of other foreign gentlemen."<sup><a href="#fn251"
name="rfn251">[251]</a></sup></p>

<p>Englishmen found the academies very useful retreats where a boy could
learn French accomplishments without incurring the dangers of foreign
travel and make the acquaintance of young nobles of his own age. Mr Thomas
Lorkin writing from Paris in 1610, outlines to the tutor of the Prince of
Wales the routine of his pupil Mr Puckering<sup><a href="#fn252"
name="rfn252">[252]</a></sup> at such an establishment. The morning <a
name="Page_123"></a>began with two hours on horseback, followed by two
hours at the French tongue, and one hour in "learning to handle his
weapon." Dinner was at twelve o'clock, where the company continued together
till two, "either passing the time in discourse or in some honest
recreation perteyning to armes." At two the bell rang for dancing, and at
three another gong sent the pupil to his own room with his tutor, to study
Latin and French for two hours. "After supper a brief survey of
all."<sup><a href="#fn253" name="rfn253">[253]</a></sup></p>

<p>It will be seen that there was an exact balance between physical and
mental exercise--four hours of each. All in all, academies seemed to be the
solution of preparing for life those who were destined to shine at Court.
The problem had been felt in England, as well as in France. In 1561, Sir
Nicholas Bacon had devised "Articles for the bringing up in virtue and
learning of the Queens Majesties Wardes."<sup><a href="#fn254"
name="rfn254">[254]</a></sup> Lord Burghley is said to have propounded the
creation of a school of arms and exercises.<sup><a href="#fn255"
name="rfn255">[255]</a></sup> In 1570, Sir Humphrey Gilbert drew up an
elaborate proposal for an "Academy of philosophy and chivalry,"<sup><a
href="#fn256" name="rfn256">[256]</a></sup> but <a name="Page_124"></a>none
of these plans was carried out. Nor was that of Prince Henry, who had also
wanted to establish a Royal Academy or School of Arms, in which all the
king's wards and others should be educated and exercised.<sup><a
href="#fn257" name="rfn257">[257]</a></sup> A certain Sir Francis Kinaston,
esquire of the body to Charles I., "more addicted to the superficiall parts
of learning--poetry and oratory (wherein he excell'd)--than to logic and
philosophy," Wood says, did get a licence to erect an academy in his house
in Covent Garden, "which should be for ever a college for the education of
the young nobility and others, sons of gentlemen, and should be styled the
Mus&aelig;um Minerv&aelig;."<sup><a href="#fn258"
name="rfn258">[258]</a></sup> But whatever start was made in that direction
ended with the Civil War.</p>

<p>However, the idea of setting up in England the sort of academy which was
successful in France was such an obvious one that it kept constantly
recurring. In 1649 a courtly parasite, Sir Balthazar Gerbier, who used to
be a miniature painter, an art-critic, and Master of Ceremonies to Charles
I., being sadly thrown out of occupation by the Civil War, opened an
academy at Bethnal Green. There are still in existence his elaborate
advertisements of its attractions, addressed to "All Fathers of Noble
Families and Lovers of <a name="Page_125"></a>Vertue," and proposing his
school as "a meanes, whereby to free them of such charges as they are at,
when they send their children to foreign academies, and to render them more
knowing in those languages, without exposing them to the dangers incident
to travellers, and to that of evill companies, or of giving to forrain
parts the glory of their education."<sup><a href="#fn259"
name="rfn259">[259]</a></sup> But Gerbier was a flimsy character, and
without a Court to support him, or money, his academy dissolved after a
gaseous lecture or two. Faubert, however, another French Protestant
refugee, was more successful with an academy he managed to set up in London
in 1682, "to lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending
children into France to be taught military exercises."<sup><a href="#fn260"
name="rfn260">[260]</a></sup> Evelyn, who was a patron of this enterprise,
describes how he "went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young gallants do
their exercise, Mr Faubert having newly railed in a man&egrave;ge, and
fitted it for the academy. There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.... But the Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this
exercise these twelve years before."<sup><a href="#fn261"
name="rfn261">[261]</a></sup> However, Faubert's <a
name="Page_126"></a>could not have been an important institution, since in
1700, a certain Dr Maidwell tried to get the Government to convert a great
house of his near Westminster into a public academy of the French sort, as
a greatly needed means of rearing gentlemen.<sup><a href="#fn262"
name="rfn262">[262]</a></sup></p>

<p>But all these efforts to educate English boys on the lines of French
ones came to nothing, because at the close of the seventeenth century
Englishmen began to realize that it was not wise for a gentleman to confine
himself to a military life. As to riding as a fine art, his practical mind
felt that it was all very well to amuse oneself in Paris by learning to
make a war-horse caracole, but there was no use in taking such things too
seriously; that in war "a ruder way of riding was more in use, without
observing the precise rules of riding the great horse."<sup><a
href="#fn263" name="rfn263">[263]</a></sup> He could not feel that artistic
passion for form in horsemanship which breathes from the pages of
Pluvinel's book <i>Le Maneige Royal</i><sup><a href="#fn264"
name="rfn264">[264]</a></sup> in which magnificent engravings show Louis
XIII. making courbettes, voltes, <a name="Page_127"></a>and "caprioles"
around the Louvre, while a circle of grandees gravely discuss the
deportment of his charger. Even Sir Philip Sidney made gentle fun of the
hippocentric universe of his Italian riding master:</p>

<p>"When the right vertuous Edward Wotton, and I, were at the Emperors
Court together, wee gave ourselves to learne horsemanship of John Pietro
Pugliano: one that with great commendation had the place of an esquire in
his stable. And hee, according to the fertilnes of the Italian wit, did not
onely afoord us the demonstration of his practise, but sought to enrich our
mindes with the contemplations therein, which hee thought most precious.
But with none I remember mine eares were at any time more loden, then when
(ether angred with slowe paiment, or mooved with our learner-like
admiration,) he exercised his speech in the prayse of his facultie. Hee
sayd, Souldiers were the noblest estate of mankinde, and horsemen, the
noblest of Souldiours. He sayde, they were the Maistres of warre, and
ornaments of peace: speedy goers, and strong abiders, triumphers both in
Camps and Courts. Nay, to so unbeleeved a poynt hee proceeded, as that no
earthly thing bred such wonder to a Prince, as to be a good horseman. Skill
of government, was but a Pedanteria in comparison: then woulde he <a
name="Page_128"></a>adde certaine prayses, by telling what a peerlesse
beast a horse was. The only serviceable Courtier without flattery, the
beast of the most beutie, faithfulness, courage, and such more, that if I
had not beene a peece of a Logician before I came to him, I think he would
have perswaded mee to have wished my selfe a Horse."<sup><a href="#fn265"
name="rfn265">[265]</a></sup></p>

<p>That this was somewhat the spirit of the French academies there seems no
doubt. Though they claimed to give an equal amount of physical and mental
exercise, they tended to the muscular side of the programme. Pluvinel, says
Tallemant des R&eacute;aux, "was hardly more intelligent than his
horses,"<sup><a href="#fn266" name="rfn266">[266]</a></sup> and the
academies are supposed to have declined after his death.<sup><a
href="#fn267" name="rfn267">[267]</a></sup> "All that is to be learned in
these Academies," says Clarendon, "is Riding, Dancing, and Fencing, besides
some Wickednesses they do not profess to teach. It is true they have men
there who teach Arithmetick, which they call Philosophy, and the Art of
Fortification, which they call the Mathematicks; but what Learning they had
there, I might easily imagine, when he assured me, that in Three <a
name="Page_129"></a>years which he had spent in the Academy, he never saw a
Latin book nor any Master that taught anything there, who would not have
taken it very ill to be suspected to speake or understand Latin."<sup><a
href="#fn268" name="rfn268">[268]</a></sup> This sort of aspersion was
continued by Dr Wallis, the Savilian Professor of Mathematics at Oxford in
1700, who was roused to a fine pitch of indignation by Maidwell's efforts
to start an academy in London:<sup><a href="#fn269"
name="rfn269">[269]</a></sup></p>

<p>"Of teachers in the academie, scarce any of a higher character than a
valet-de-chambre. And, if such an one, who (for instance) hath waited on
his master in one or two campagnes, and is able perhaps to copy the draught
of a fortification from another paper; this is called mathematicks; and,
beyond this (if so much) you are not to expect."</p>

<p>A certain Mr P. Chester finishes the English condemnation of a school,
such as Benjamin's, by declaring that its pretensions to fit men for life
was "like the shearing of Hoggs, much Noyse and little Wooll, nothing
considerable taught that I know, butt only to fitt a man to <a
name="Page_130"></a>be a French chevalier, that is in plain English a
Trooper."<sup><a href="#fn270" name="rfn270">[270]</a></sup></p>

<p>These comments are what one expects from Oxford, to be sure, but even M.
Jusserand acknowledges that the academies were not centres of intellectual
light, and quotes to prove it certain questions asked of a pupil put into
the Bastille, at the demand of his father:</p>

<p>"Was it not true that the Sieur Varin, his father, seeing that he had no
inclination to study, had put him into the Acad&eacute;mie Royale to there
learn all sorts of exercises, and had there supported him with much
expense?</p>

<p>"He admitted that his father, while his mother was living, had put him
into the Acad&eacute;mie Royale and had given him for that the necessary
means, and paid the ordinary pension, 1600 livres a year.</p>

<p>"Was it not true that after having been some time at the Acad&eacute;mie
Royale, he was expelled, having disguised girls in boys' clothes to bring
them there?</p>

<p>"He denied it. He had never introduced into the school any
acad&eacute;miste f&eacute;minine: he had departed at the summons of his
father, having taken proper leave of M. and Mme. de Poix."<sup><a
href="#fn271" name="rfn271">[271]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_131"></a>However, something of an education had to be
provided for Royalist boys at the time of the Civil War, when Oxford was
demoralized. Parents wandering homeless on the Continent were glad enough
of the academies. Even the Stuarts tried them, though the Duke of
Gloucester had to be weaned from the company of some young French gallants,
"who, being educated in the same academy, were more familiar with him than
was thought convenient."<sup><a href="#fn272" name="rfn272">[272]</a></sup>
It was a choice between academies or such an education as Edmund Verney
endured in a dull provincial city as the sole pupil of an exiled Regius
Professor of Greek at Cambridge. But the effects of being reared in France,
and too early thrown into the dissolute Courts of Europe, were evident at
the Restoration, when Charles the Second and his friends returned to
startle England with their "exceeding wildness." What else could be the
effect of a youth spent as the Earl of Chesterfield records:<sup><a
href="#fn273" name="rfn273">[273]</a></sup> at thirteen years old a
courtier at St Germaine: at fourteen, rid of any governor or tutor: at
sixteen, at the academy of M. de Veau, he "chanced to have a quarrel with
M. Morvay, since Captaine of the French King's Guards, who I hurt and
disarmed in a duel." <a name="Page_132"></a>Thereupon he left the academy
and took up his abode at the Court of Turin. It was from Italy, De Gramont
said, that Chesterfield brought those elaborate manners, and that jealousy
about women, for which he was so notorious among the rakes of the
Restoration.<sup><a href="#fn274" name="rfn274">[274]</a></sup></p>

<p>Henry Peacham's chapter "Of Travaile"<sup><a href="#fn275"
name="rfn275">[275]</a></sup> is for the most part built out of
Dallington's advice, but it is worthy of note that in <i>The Compleat
Gentleman</i>, Spain is pressed upon the traveller's attention for the
first time. This is, of course, the natural reflection of an interest in
Spain due to the romantic adventures of Prince Charles and Buckingham in
that country. James Howell, who was of their train, gives even more space
to it in his <i>Instructions for Forreine Travell</i>. Notwithstanding, and
though Spain was, after 1605, fairly safe for Englishmen, as a pleasure
ground it was not popular. It was a particularly uncomfortable and
expensive country; hardly improved from the time--(1537)--when Clenardus,
weary with traversing deserts on his way to the University of Salamanca,
after a sparse meal of rabbit, sans wine, sans water, composed himself to
sleep on the floor of a little hut, with nothing to pillow his head on
except his three negro <a name="Page_133"></a>grooms, and exclaimed, "O
misera Lusitania, beati qui non viderunt."<sup><a href="#fn276"
name="rfn276">[276]</a></sup> All civilization was confined to the few
large cities, to reach which one was obliged to traverse tedious, hot,
barren, and unprofitable wastes, in imminent danger of robbers, and in
certainty of the customs officers, who taxed people for everything, even
the clothes they had on. None escaped. Henry the Eighth's Ambassador
complained loudly and frantically of the outrage to a person in his
office.<sup><a href="#fn277" name="rfn277">[277]</a></sup> So did
Elizabeth's Ambassador. But the officers said grimly "that if Christ or
Sanct Fraunces came with all their flock they should not escape."<sup><a
href="#fn278" name="rfn278">[278]</a></sup> If the preliminary discomforts
from customs-officers put travellers into an ill mood at once against
Spain, the inns confirmed them in it. "In some places there is but the cask
of a House, with a little napery, but sometimes no beds at all for
Passengers in the Ventas--or Lodgings on the King's highway, where if
passengers meet, they must carry their Knapsacks well provided of what is
necessary: otherwise they may go to bed <a
name="Page_134"></a>supperless."<sup><a href="#fn279"
name="rfn279">[279]</a></sup> The Comtesse d'Aunoy grumbles that it was
impossible to warm oneself at the kitchen-fire without being choked, for
there was no chimney. Besides the room was full of men and women, "blacker
than Devils and clad like Beggars ... always some of 'em impudently grating
on a sorry Guitar."<sup><a href="#fn280" name="rfn280">[280]</a></sup> Even
the large cities were not diverting, for though they were handsome enough
and could show "certain massie and solid Braveries," yet they had few of
the attractions of urban life. The streets were so ill-paved that the
horses splashed water into one's carriage at every step.<sup><a
href="#fn281" name="rfn281">[281]</a></sup> A friend warned Tobie Matthew
that "In the Cities you shall find so little of the Italian delicacie for
the manner of their buildings, the cleannesse and sweetnesse of their
streets, their way of living, their entertainments for recreations by
Villas, Gardens, Walks, Fountains, Academies, Arts of Painting,
Architecture and the like, that you would rather suspect that they did but
live together for fear of wolves."<sup><a href="#fn282"

<p><a name="Page_135"></a>How little the solemnity of the Spanish nobles
pleased English courtiers used to the boisterous ways of James I. and his
"Steenie," may be gathered from <i>The Perambulation of Spain.</i><sup><a
href="#fn283" name="rfn283">[283]</a></sup> "You must know," says the first
character in that dialogue, "that there is a great deal of gravity and
state in the Catholic Court, but little noise, and few people; so that it
may be call'd a Monastery, rather than a Royal Court." The economy in such
a place was a great source of grievance. "By this means the King of Spain
spends not much," says the second character. "So little," is the reply,
"that I dare wager the French King spends more in Pages and Laquays, than
he of Spain among all his Court Attendants." Buckingham's train jeered at
the abstemious fare they received.<sup><a href="#fn284"
name="rfn284">[284]</a></sup> It was in such irritating contrast to the
lofty airs of those who provided it. "We are still extream poor," writes
the English Ambassador about the Court of Madrid, "yet as proud as Divells,
yea even as rich Divells."<sup><a href="#fn285"
name="rfn285">[285]</a></sup> Not only at Court, but everywhere, Spaniards
were indifferent to strangers, and not at all interested in pleasing them.
Lord Clarendon remarks that in Madrid travellers "will find less delight to
reside than in any other Place to <a name="Page_136"></a>which we have
before commended them: for that Nation having less Reverence for meer
Travellers, who go Abroad, without Business, are not at all solicitous to
provide for their Accomodation: and when they complain of the want of many
Conveniences, as they have reason to do, they wonder men will come from
Home, who will be troubled for those Incommodities."<sup><a href="#fn286"
name="rfn286">[286]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that Spain was considered a rather tedious
country for strangers, and that Howell "met more Passengers 'twixt Paris
and Orleans, than I found well neer in all the Journey through
Spain."<sup><a href="#fn287" name="rfn287">[287]</a></sup> Curiosity and a
desire to learn the language might carry a man to Madrid for a time, but
Englishmen could find little to commend there. Holland, on the other hand,
provoked their admiration more and more. Travellers were never done
exclaiming at its municipal governments, its reformatories and workhouses,
its industry, frugality, and social economy. The neat buildings, elegant
streets, and quiet inns, were the subject of many encomiums.<sup><a
href="#fn288" name="rfn288">[288]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_137"></a>Descartes, who chose Amsterdam as the place in
which to think out his philosophy, praised it as the ideal retreat for
students, contending that it was far better for them than Italy, with its
plagues, heat, unwholesome evenings, murder and robbery.<sup><a
href="#fn289" name="rfn289">[289]</a></sup> Locke, when he went into
voluntary exile in 1684, enjoyed himself with the doctors and men of
letters in Amsterdam, attending by special invitation of the principal
physician of the city the dissection of a lioness, or discussing knotty
problems of theology with the wealthy Quaker merchants.<sup><a
href="#fn290" name="rfn290">[290]</a></sup> Courtiers were charmed with the
sea-shore at Scheveningen, where on the hard sand, admirably contrived by
nature for the divertisement of persons of quality, the foreign ambassadors
and their ladies, and the society of the Hague, drove in their coaches and
six horses.<sup><a href="#fn291" name="rfn291">[291]</a></sup> However, Sir
William Temple, after some years spent as Ambassador to the Netherlands,
decided that Holland was a place where a man would choose rather to travel
than to live, because it was a country where there was more sense than wit,
more wealth than pleasure, and where one <a name="Page_138"></a>would find

<p>Holland was of peculiar delight to the traveller of the seventeenth
century because it contained so many curiosities and rareties. To ferret
out objects of vertu the Jacobean gentleman would take any journey. People
with cabinets of butterflies, miniatures, shells, ivory, or Indian beads,
were pestered by tourists asking to see their treasures.<sup><a
href="#fn293" name="rfn293">[293]</a></sup> No garden was so entrancing to
them as one that had "a rupellary nidary"<sup><a href="#fn294"
name="rfn294">[294]</a></sup> or an aviary with eagles, cranes, storks,
bustards, ducks with four wings, or with rabbits of an almost perfect
yellow colour.<sup><a href="#fn295" name="rfn295">[295]</a></sup> Holland,
therefore, where ships brought precious curiosities from all over the
world, was a heaven for the virtuoso. Evelyn in Rotterdam hovered between
his delight in the brass statue of Erasmus and a pelican, which he
carefully describes. The great charm of Dutch inns for Sam Paterson was
their hoards of China and Japan ware and the probability you had of meeting
a purring marmot, a squeaking guinea-pig, or a <a name="Page_139"></a>tame
rabbit with a collar of bells, hopping through the house.<sup><a
href="#fn296" name="rfn296">[296]</a></sup></p>

<p>But we have dwelt too long, perhaps, on those who voyaged to see
knick-knacks, and to gain accomplishments at French academies. Though the
academies were characteristic of the seventeenth century, there were other
centres of education sought by Englishmen abroad. The study of medicine,
particularly, took many students to Padua or Paris, for the Continent was
far ahead of England in scientific work.<sup><a href="#fn297"
name="rfn297">[297]</a></sup> Sir Thomas Browne's son studied anatomy at
Padua with Sir John Finch, who had settled there and was afterwards chosen
syndic of the university.<sup><a href="#fn298"
name="rfn298">[298]</a></sup> At Paris Martin Lister, though in the train
of the English Ambassador, principally enjoyed "Mr Bennis in the
dissecting-room working by himself upon a dead body," and "took more
pleasure to see Monsieur Breman in his white waistcoat digging in the royal
physic-garden and sowing his couches, than Mounsieur de Saintot making room
for an ambassador": and found himself better disposed and more apt to learn
the names <a name="Page_140"></a>and physiognomy of a hundred plants, than
of five or six princes.<sup><a href="#fn299"
name="rfn299">[299]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was medicine that chiefly interested Nicholas Ferrar, than whom no
traveller for study's sake was ever more devoted to the task of
self-improvement. At about the same time that the second Earl of
Chesterfield was fighting duels at the academy of Monsieur de Veau,
Nicholas Ferrar, a grave boy, came from Cambridge to Leipsic and "set
himself laboriously to study the originals of the city, the nature of the
government, the humors and inclinations of the people." Finding the
university too distracting, he retired to a neighbouring village to read
the choicest writers on German affairs. He served an apprenticeship of a
fortnight at every German trade. He could maintain a dialogue with an
architect in his own phrases; he could talk with mariners in their sea
terms. Removing to Padua, he attained in a very short time a marvellous
proficiency in physic, while his conversation and his charm ennobled the
evil students of Padua.<sup><a href="#fn300"

<h3>THE GRAND TOUR</h3>


<p>After the Restoration the idea of polishing one's parts by foreign
travel received fresh impetus. The friends of Charles the Second, having
spent so much of their time abroad, naturally brought back to England a
renewed infusion of continental ideals. France was more than ever the
arbiter for the "gentry and civiller sort of mankind." Travellers such as
Evelyn, who deplored the English gentry's "solitary and unactive lives in
the country," the "haughty and boorish Englishman," and the "constrained
address of our sullen Nation,"<sup><a href="#fn301"
name="rfn301">[301]</a></sup> made an impression. It was generally
acknowledged that comity and affability had to be fetched from beyond the
Seas, for the "meer Englishman" was defective in those qualities. He was
"rough in address, not easily acquainted, and blunt even when he
obliged."<sup><a href="#fn302" name="rfn302">[302]</a></sup></p>

<p>Even wise and honest Englishmen began to be ashamed of their manners and
felt they must try to be not quite so English. "Put on a decent <a
name="Page_142"></a>boldness," writes Sir Thomas Browne constantly to his
son in France. "Shun pudor rusticus." "Practise an handsome garb and civil
boldness which he that learneth not in France, travaileth in vain."<sup><a
href="#fn303" name="rfn303">[303]</a></sup></p>

<p>But there was this difference in travel to complete the gentleman during
the reign of Charles the Second: that Italy and Germany were again safe and
thrown open to travellers, so that Holland, Germany, Italy, and France made
a magnificent round of sights; namely, the Grand Tour. It was still usual
to spend some time in Paris learning exercises and accomplishments at an
academy, but a large proportion of effort went to driving by post-chaise
through the principal towns of Europe. Since it was a great deal easier to
go sight-seeing than to study governments, write "relations," or even to
manage "The Great Horse," the Grand Tour, as a form of education, gained
upon society, especially at the end of the century, when even the academies
were too much of an exertion for the beaux to attend. To dress well and to
be witty superseded martial ambitions. Gentlemen could no longer endure the
violence of the Great Horse, but were carried about in sedan chairs. To
drive through Europe in a coach suited them very well. It was a form of
travel <a name="Page_143"></a>which likewise suited country squires' sons;
for with the spread of the fashion from Court to country not only great
noblemen and "utter gallants" but plain country gentlemen aspired to send
their sons on a quest for the "bel air." Their idea of how this was to be
done being rather vague, the services of a governor were hired, who found
that the easiest way of dealing with Tony Lumpkin was to convey him over an
impressive number of miles and keep him interested with staring at
buildings. The whole aim of travel was sadly degenerated from Elizabethan
times. Cynical parents like Francis Osborn had not the slightest faith in
its good effects, but recommended it solely because it was the fashion.
"Some to starch a more serious face upon wanton, impertinent, and dear
bought Vanity, cry up 'Travel' as 'the best Accomplisher of Youth and
Gentry,' tho' detected by Experience in the generality, for 'the greatest
Debaucher' ... yet since it advanceth Opinion in the World, without which
Desert is useful to none but itself (Scholars and Travellers being cried up
for the highest Graduates in the most universal Judgments) I am not much
unwilling to give way to Peregrine motion for a time."<sup><a href="#fn304"
name="rfn304">[304]</a></sup></p>

<p>In short, the object of the Grand Tour was to see and be seen. The very
term seems to be an <a name="Page_144"></a>extension of usage from the word
employed to describe driving in one's coach about the principal streets of
a town. The Duchess of Newcastle, in 1656, wrote from Antwerp: "I go
sometimes abroad, seldom to visit, but only in my coach about the town, or
about some of the streets, which we call here a tour, where all the chief
of the town go to see and be seen, likewise all strangers of what quality
soever."<sup><a href="#fn305" name="rfn305">[305]</a></sup> Evelyn, in
1652, contrasted "making the Tour" with the proper sort of industrious
travel; "But he that (instead of making the Tour, as they call it) or, as a
late Embassador of ours facetiously, but sharply reproached, (like a Goose
swimms down the River) having mastered the Tongue, frequented the Court,
looked into their customes, been present at their pleadings, observed their
Military Discipline, contracted acquaintance with their Learned men,
studied their Arts, and is familiar with their dispositions, makes this
accompt of his time."<sup><a href="#fn306" name="rfn306">[306]</a></sup>
And in another place he says: "It is written of Ulysses, that hee saw many
Cities indeed, but withall his Remarks of mens Manners and Customs, was
ever preferred to his counting Steeples, and making Tours: It is this
Ethicall <a name="Page_145"></a>and Morall part of Travel, which
embellisheth a Gentleman."<sup><a href="#fn307"
name="rfn307">[307]</a></sup> In 1670, Richard Lassels uses the term "Grand
Tour" for the first time in an English book for travellers: "The Grand Tour
of France and the Giro of Italy."<sup><a href="#fn308"
name="rfn308">[308]</a></sup> Of course this is only specialized usage of
the idea "round" which had long been current, and which still survives in
our phrase, "make the round trip." "The Spanish ambassadors," writes Dudley
Carleton in 1610, "are at the next Spring to make a perfect round."<sup><a

<p>In the age of the Grand Tour the governor becomes an important figure.
There had always been governors, to be sure, from the very beginnings of
travel to become a complete person. Their arguments with fathers as to the
expenses of the tour, and their laments at the disagreeable conduct of
their charges echo from generation to generation. Now it is Mr Windebanke
complaining to Cecil that his son "has utterly no mind nor disposition in
him to apply any learning, according to the end you sent him for hither,"
being carried away by an "inordinate affection towards a young gentlewoman
abiding near Paris."<sup><a href="#fn310" name="rfn310">[310]</a></sup> Now
<a name="Page_146"></a>it is Mr Smythe desiring to be called home unless
the allowance for himself and Francis Davison can be increased. "For Mr
Francis is now a man, and your son, and not so easily ruled touching
expenses, about which we have had more brabblements than I will speak
of."<sup><a href="#fn311" name="rfn311">[311]</a></sup> Bacon's essay "Of
Travel" in 1625 is the first to advise the use of a governor;<sup><a
href="#fn312" name="rfn312">[312]</a></sup> but governors rose to their
full authority only in the middle of the century, when it was the custom to
send boys abroad very young, at fourteen or fifteen, because at that age
they were more malleable for instruction in foreign languages. At that age
they could not generally be trusted by themselves, especially after the
protests of a century against the moral and religious dangers of foreign
travel. How fearful parents were of the hazards of travel, and what a
responsibility it was for a governor to undertake one of these precious
charges, may be gathered from this letter by Lady Lowther to Joseph
Williamson, he who afterwards rose to be <a name="Page_147"></a>Secretary
of State: "I doubt not but you have received my son," writes the mother,
"with our letters entreating your care for improving all good in him and
restraining all irregularities, as he is the hope and only stem of his
father. I implore the Almighty, and labour for all means conducible
thereto; I conceive your discreet government and admonition may much
promote it. Tell me whether you find him tractable or disorderly: his
disposition is good, and his natural parts reasonable, but his acquirements
meaner than I desire: however he is young enough yet to learn, and by study
may recover, if not recall, his lost time.</p>

<p>"In the first place, endeavour to settle him in his religion, as the
basis of all our other hopes, and the more to be considered in regard of
the looseness of the place where you are. I doubt not but you have well
considered of the resolve to travel to Italy, yet I have this to say for my
fond fears (besides the imbecility of my sex) my affections are all
contracted into one head: also I know the hotness of his temper, apt to
feverishness. Yet I submit him to your total management, only praying the
God of Heaven to direct you for the best, and to make him tractable to you,
and laborious for his own advancement."<sup><a href="#fn313"
name="rfn313">[313]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_148"></a>A governor became increasingly necessary as the
arbiter of what was modish for families whose connection with the
fashionable world was slight. He assumed airs of authority, and took to
writing books on how the Grand Tour should be made. Such is <i>The Voyage
of Italy</i>, with <i>Instructions concerning Travel</i>, by <i>Richard
Lassels, Gent.</i>, who "travelled through Italy Five times, as Tutor to
several of the English Nobility and Gentry."<sup><a href="#fn314"
name="rfn314">[314]</a></sup> Lassels, in reciting the benefits of travel,
plays upon that growing sensitiveness of the country gentleman about his
innocent peculiarities: "The Country Lord that never saw anybody but his
Father's Tenants and M. Parson, and never read anything but John Stow, and
Speed; thinks the Land's-end to be the World's-end; and that all solid
greatness, next unto a great Pasty, consists in a great Fire, and a great
estate;" or, "My Country gentleman that never travelled, can scarce go to
London without making his Will, at least without wetting his
hand-kerchief."<sup><a href="#fn315" name="rfn315">[315]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_149"></a>The Grand Tour, of course, is the remedy for
these weaknesses--especially under the direction of a wise governor. More
care should go to choosing that governor than to any other retainer. For
lacqueys and footmen "are like his Galoshooes, which he leaves at the doors
of those he visits," but his governor is like his shirt, always next him,
and should therefore be of the best material. The revelation of bad
governors in Lassels' instructions are enough to make one recoil from the
Grand Tour altogether. These "needy bold men" led pupils to Geneva, where
the pupils lost all their true English allegiance and respect for monarchy;
they kept them in dull provincial cities where the governor's wife or
mistress happened to live. "Others have been observed to sell their pupils
to Masters of exercises, and to have made them believe that the worst
Academies were the best, because they were the best to the cunning
Governour, who had ten pound a man for every one he could draw thither:
Others I have known who would have married their Pupils in France without
their Parents' knowledge";<sup><a href="#fn316"
name="rfn316">[316]</a></sup> ... and so forth, with other more lurid
examples.</p>

<p>The difficulties of procuring the right sort of governor were hardly
exaggerated by Lassels. The Duke of Ormond's grandson had just such a <a
name="Page_150"></a>dishonest tutor as described--one who instead of
showing the Earl of Ossory the world, carried him among his own relations,
and "buried" him at Orange.<sup><a href="#fn317"
name="rfn317">[317]</a></sup> It seems odd, at first sight, that the Earl
of Salisbury's son should be entrusted to Sir John Finet, who endeared
himself to James the First by his remarkable skill in composing "bawdy
songs."<sup><a href="#fn318" name="rfn318">[318]</a></sup> It astonishes us
to read that Lord Clifford's governor, Mr Beecher, lost his temper at play,
and called Sir Walter Chute into the field,<sup><a href="#fn319"
name="rfn319">[319]</a></sup> or that Sir Walter Raleigh's son was able to
exhibit his governor, Ben Jonson, dead-drunk upon a car, "which he made to
be drawn by pioneers through the streets, at every corner showing his
governor stretched out, and telling them that was a more lively image of a
crucifix than any they had."<sup><a href="#fn320"
name="rfn320">[320]</a></sup> But it took a manly man to be a governor at
all. It was not safe to select a merely intelligent and virtuous tutor;
witness <a name="Page_151"></a>the case of the Earl of Derby sent abroad in
1673, with Mr James Forbes, "a gentleman of parts, virtue and prudence, but
of too mild a nature to manage his pupil." The adventures of these two, as
narrated by Carte in his life of Ormond, are doubtless typical.</p>

<p>"They had not been three months at Paris, before a misunderstanding
happened between them that could not be made up, so that both wrote over to
the duke (of Ormond) complaining of one another. His grace immediately
dispatched over Mr Muleys to inquire into the ground of the quarrel, in
order to reconcile them.... The earl had forgot the advice which the duke
had given him, to make himself acquainted with the people of quality in
France, and to keep as little correspondence with his own countrymen,
whilst he was abroad, as was consistent with good manners; and had formed
an intimate acquaintance with a lewd, debauched young fellow whom he found
at Paris, and who was the son of Dr Merrit, a physician. The governor had
cautioned his young nobleman against creating a friendship with so
worthless a person, who would draw him into all manner of vice and expense,
and lead him into numberless inconveniences. Merrit, being told of this,
took Mr Forbes one day at an advantage in an house, and <a
name="Page_152"></a>wounded him dangerously. The earl, instead of
manifesting his resentment as he ought in such a case, seemed rather
pleased with the affair, and still kept on his intimacy with Merrit. The
duke finding that Merrit had as ill a character from all that knew him in
London, as Mr Forbes had given him, easily suspected the earl was in the
wrong, and charged Muleys to represent to him the ill fame of the man, and
how unworthy he was of his lordship's acquaintance and conversation....</p>

<p>"When Muleys came to Paris, he found the matters very bad on Lord
Derby's side, who had not only countenanced Merrit's assault, but, at the
instigation of some young French rakes, had consented to his governor's
being tossed in a blanket. The earl was wild, full of spirits, and
impatient of restraint: Forbes was a grave, sober, mild man, and his sage
remonstrances had no manner of effect on his pupil. The duke, seeing what
the young gentleman would be at, resolved to send over one that should
govern him. For this purpose he pitched upon Colonel Thomas Fairfax, a
younger son of the first lord Fairfax, a gallant and brave man (as all the
Fairfaxes were), and roughly honest. Lord Derby was restless at first: but
the colonel told him sharply, that he was sent to govern him, and would
govern him: <a name="Page_153"></a>that his lordship must submit, and
should do it; so that the best method he had to take, was to do it with
decorum and good humour. He soon discharged the vicious and scandalous part
of the earl's acquaintance, and signified to the rest, that he had the
charge of the young nobleman, who was under his government: and therefore
if any of them should ever have a quarrel with his pupil, who was young and
inexperienced, he himself was their man, and would give them satisfaction.
His courage was too well known to tempt anybody make a trial of it; the
nobleness of his family, and his own personal merit, procured him respect
from all the world, as well as from his pupil. No quarrel happened: the
earl was reclaimed, being always very observant of his governor. He left
Paris, and passing down the Loire went to the south of France, received in
all places by the governors of towns and provinces with great respect and
uncommon marks of honour and distinction. From thence he went into Italy,
making a handsome figure in all places, and travelling with as much dignity
as any nobleman whatever at little more than one thousand two hundred
pounds a year expense; so easy is it to make a figure in those countries
with virtue, decorum, and good management."<sup><a href="#fn321"
name="rfn321">[321]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_154"></a>This concluding remark of Carte's gives us the
point of view of certain families; that it was more economical to live
abroad. It certainly was--for courtiers who had to pay eighty pounds for a
suit of clothes--without trimming<sup><a href="#fn322"
name="rfn322">[322]</a></sup>--and spent two thousand pounds on a supper to
the king.<sup><a href="#fn323" name="rfn323">[323]</a></sup> Francis Osborn
considered one of the chief benefits of travel to be the training in
economy which it afforded: "Frugality being of none so perfectly learned as
of the Italian and the Scot; Natural to the first, and as necessary to the
latter."<sup><a href="#fn324" name="rfn324">[324]</a></sup>
Notwithstanding, the cost of travel had in the extravagant days of the
Stuarts much increased. The Grand Tour cost more than travel in Elizabethan
days, when young men quietly settled down for hard study in some German or
Italian town. Robert Sidney, for instance, had only &pound;100 a year when
he was living with Sturm. "Tearm yt as you wyll, it ys all I owe you," said
his father. "Harry Whyte ... shall have his &pound;20 yearly, and you your
&pound;100; and so be as mery as you may."<sup><a href="#fn325"
name="rfn325">[325]</a></sup> Secretary Davison expected his son, his
tutor, and their servant to live on this <a name="Page_155"></a>amount at
Venice. "Mr. Wo." had said this would suffice.<sup><a href="#fn326"
name="rfn326">[326]</a></sup> If "Mr Wo." means Mr Wotton, as it probably
does, since Wotton had just returned from abroad in 1594, and Francis
Davison set out in 1595, he was an authority on economical travel, for he
used to live in Germany at the rate of one shilling, four pence halfpenny a
day for board and lodging.<sup><a href="#fn327"
name="rfn327">[327]</a></sup> But he did not carry with him a governor and
an English servant. Moryson, Howell, and Dallington all say that expenses
for a servant amounted to &pound;50 yearly. Therefore Davison's tutor quite
rightly protested that &pound;200 would not suffice for three people.
Although they spent "not near so much as other gentlemen of their nation at
Venice, and though he went to market himself and was as frugal as could be,
the expenses would mount up to forty shillings a week, not counting apparel
and books." "I protest I never endured so much slavery in my life to save
money," he laments.<sup><a href="#fn328" name="rfn328">[328]</a></sup> When
learning accomplishments in France took the place of student-life in Italy,
expenses naturally rose. Moryson, who travelled as a humanist, for
"knowledge of State affaires, Histories, Cosmography, and the like," found
that fifty or sixty pounds were enough to <a name="Page_156"></a>"beare the
charge of a Traveller's diet, necessary apparrell, and two Journies
yeerely, in the Spring and Autumne, and also to serve him for moderate
expences of pleasure."<sup><a href="#fn329" name="rfn329">[329]</a></sup>
But Dallington found that an education of the French sort would come to
just twice as much. "If he Travell without a servant fourscore pounds
sterling is a competent proportion, except he learne to ride: if he
maintaine both these charges, he can be allowed no lesse than one hundred
and fiftie poundes: and to allowe above two hundred, were superfluous, and
to his hurte. And thus rateably, according to the number he keepeth.</p>

<p>"The ordinarie rate of his expence, is this: ten gold crownes a moneth
his owne dyet, eight for his man, (at the most) two crownes a moneth his
fencing, as much dancing, no lesse his reading, and fiftene crownes
monethly his ridings: but this exercise he shall discontinue all the heate
of the yeare. The remainder of his 150 pound I allow him for apparell,
bookes, Travelling charges, tennis play, and other extraordinaire
expences."<sup><a href="#fn330" name="rfn330">[330]</a></sup> A few years
later Howell fixes annual expense at &pound;300--(&pound;50 extra for every
servant.) These three hundred pounds are to pay for riding, dancing,
fencing, tennis, clothes, and <a name="Page_157"></a>coach hire--a new item
of necessity. An academy would seem to have been a cheaper means of
learning accomplishments. For about &pound;110 one might have lodging and
diet for himselfe and a man and be taught to ride, fence, ply mathematics,
and so forth.<sup><a href="#fn331" name="rfn331">[331]</a></sup> Lassels
very wisely refrains from telling those not already persuaded, what the
cost will be for the magnificent Grand Tour he outlines. We calculate that
it would be over &pound;500, for the Earl of Cork paid &pound;1000 a year
for his two sons, their governor, only two servants and only
saddle-horses:<sup><a href="#fn332" name="rfn332">[332]</a></sup> whereas
Lassels hints that no one with much pretension to fashion could go through
Paris without a coach followed by three lacqueys and a page.<sup><a
href="#fn333" name="rfn333">[333]</a></sup> Evelyn, at any rate, thought
the expenses of a traveller were "vast": "And believe it Sir, if he reap
some contentment extraordinary, from what he hath observed abroad, the
pains, sollicitations, watchings, perills, journeys, ill entertainment,
absence from friends, and innumerable like inconveniences, joyned to his
vast expences, do very dearly, and by a strange kind of extortion, purchase
that smal experience and reputation which he can vaunt to have acquired
from abroad."<sup><a href="#fn334" name="rfn334">[334]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_158"></a>Perhaps some details from the education of Robert
Boyle will serve to illustrate the manner of taking the Grand Tour. His
father, the great Earl of Cork, was a devoted adherent to this form of
education and launched his numerous sons, two by two, upon the Continent.
He was, as Boyle says, the sort of person "who supplied what he wanted in
scholarship himself, by being both a passionate affecter, and eminent
patron of it."<sup><a href="#fn335" name="rfn335">[335]</a></sup> His
journal for 1638 records first the return of "My sones Lewis and Roger from
their travailes into foreign kingdomes,... ffor which their safe retorn,
god be ever humbly and heartely thancked and praised both by me and
them."<sup><a href="#fn336" name="rfn336">[336]</a></sup> In the same year
he recovered the Lord Viscount of Kynalmeaky and the Lord of Broghill, with
Mr Marcombes, their governor, from their foreign travels into France and
Italy. Then it was the turn of Francis and Robert, just removed from Eton
College. With the governor Marcombes, a French servant, and a French boy,
they departed from London in October 1639, "having his Majestie's license
under his hand and privy signett for to continew abrode 3 yeares: god guide
them abrod and safe back."<sup><a href="#fn337"
name="rfn337">[337]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_159"></a>Robert, according to his autobiography, was well
satisfied to go, but Francis, aged fifteen, had just been married to one of
the Queen's Maids of Honour, aged fourteen, and after four days of revelry
was in no mood to be thrust back into the estate of childhood.<sup><a
href="#fn338" name="rfn338">[338]</a></sup> High words passed between him
and his father on the occasion of his enforced departure for Paris. He was
so agitated that he mislaid his sword and pistols--at least so we hear by
the first letter Marcombes writes from Paris. "Mr Francis att his departure
from London was so much troubled because of your Lordship's anger against
him that he could never tell us where he put his sword and ye kaise of
pistoles that your Lordship gave them, so that I have been forced to buy
them here a kaise of pistolles a peece, because of the danger that is now
everywhere in France, and because it is so much ye mode now for every
gentleman of fashion to ride with a kase of Pistoles, that they Laugh att
those that have them not. I bought also a Sword for mr francis and when Mr
Robert saw it he did so earnestly desire me to buy him one, because his was
out of fashion, that I could not refuse him that small request."<sup><a
href="#fn339" name="rfn339">[339]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_160"></a>Marcombes did not expose the boys long to the
excitement of Paris, but at once hurried them to Geneva, and settled them
to work, where Francis showed a great deal of resignation and good-humour
in accepting his fate. He was not so sulky as Lord Cranborne, who in a
similar situation fell ill, could not eat, and had to be taken back to
England.<sup><a href="#fn340" name="rfn340">[340]</a></sup> "And as for Mr
francis," writes Marcombes to Cork, "I protest unto your Lordship that I
did not thinke yt he could frame himselfe to every kind of good Learning
with so great a facilitie and passion as he doth, having tasted already a
little drope of ye Libertinage of ye Court, but I find him soe
disciplinable, and soe desirous to repare ye time Lost, yt I make no
question but your Lordship shall receive a great ioye."<sup><a
href="#fn341" name="rfn341">[341]</a></sup> He had not had much of an
education at Eton, as his governor takes pleasure in pointing out: "For Mr
Francis I doe assure your Lordship <a name="Page_161"></a>he had need to
aplay himselfe to other things till now, for except reeding and writting
Inglish he was grounded in nothing of ye wordle (world); and beleeve me,
for before God I spake true, when I say that never any gentleman hath donne
lesse profit of his time then he had done when he went out of England: and
besides yt if he had been Longer at Eatton he had Learned there to drinke
with other deboice scholers, as I have beene in formed by Mr
Robert."<sup><a href="#fn342" name="rfn342">[342]</a></sup></p>

<p>Won over by the study of "Fortifications," a branch of mathematics very
pleasing to the seventeenth century boy, the future Viscount Shannon
applied himself to work with energy;<sup><a href="#fn343"
name="rfn343">[343]</a></sup> and for a time peace reigned over the process
of education. "Every morning," writes their tutor, "I teach them ye
Rhetoricke in Latin, and I expound unto them Justin from Latin into french,
and presently after dinner I doe reade unto them two chapters of ye old
Testament with a brief exposition of those points that I think that they
doe not understand; and before supper I teach them ye history of ye Romans
in french out of florus and of Titus Livius, and two sections of ye
Cateshisme of Caluin with ye most orthodox exposition of the <a
name="Page_162"></a>points that they doe not understand; and after supper I
doe reade unto them two chapters of ye new Testament, and both morning and
evening we say our prayers together, and twice a weeke we goe to
Church."<sup><a href="#fn344" name="rfn344">[344]</a></sup></p>

<p>The boys spoke French always, and had some dancing lessons, but no
riding lessons, for "their lyms are not knitt and strong enough, nor their
bodys hable to endure rough exercises; and besides, although wee have here
as good and skillfull teachers as in many other places, yet when they shall
come to paris or some other place, their teachers will make them beleeve
that they have Lost their time and shall make them beginn againe: for it is
their custome so to doe to all."<sup><a href="#fn345"
name="rfn345">[345]</a></sup> At tennis, however, Francis enjoyed himself,
and grew apace. "I may assure your Lordship that both his Leggs and armes
are by a third part bigger now then they were in England." Robert, even at
fourteen a studious person, "doth not Love tennisse play so much, but
delights himselfe more to be in private with some booke of history or
other, but I perswade him often both to play att tennisse and goe about. I
never saw him handsomer, for although he growes much, yet he is very fatt
and his cheeks are as red as vermilian. <a name="Page_163"></a>This Leter
end of ye winter is mighty cold and a great quantity of snow is fallen upon
ye ground, but that brings them to such a stomacke that your Lordship
should take a great pleasure to see them feed. I do not give them daintys,
but I assure your Lordship that they have allwayes good bred and Good wine,
good beef and mouton, thrice a week good capons and good fish, constantly
two dishes of fruit and a Good piece of cheese; all kind of cleane linnen
twice and thrice a week and a constant fire in their chamber wherein they
have a good bed for them, and another for their men."<sup><a href="#fn346"
name="rfn346">[346]</a></sup></p>

<p>Indeed, Marcombes was a very good governor, as Robert several times
assured the Earl of Cork, and allowed them to lack for nothing. In the
spring he bought them saddle-horses so that after their studies they might
take the air and see their friends. Since a governor had charge of all the
funds, it was a great test of his honesty whether he resisted the
temptation to economize on the clothes and spending-money of his pupils,
and to pocket the part of their allowance so saved. This is why Marcombes
often lets fall into his letters to the Earl of Cork items such as these:
"I have made a compleat black satin sute for Mr Robert: ye cloake Lined
with plush, and I <a name="Page_164"></a>allow them every moneth a peese ye
value of very neare two pounds sterlings for their passe time."<sup><a
href="#fn347" name="rfn347">[347]</a></sup></p>

<p>The only disturbing elements in the satisfactory state of Marcombes and
his pupils were the Killigrews. Thomas Killigrew, he who afterwards became
one of the dramatists of the Restoration, had then only just outgrown the
estate of page to Charles I., and in strolling about the Continent he paid
the Boyles a visit.<sup><a href="#fn348" name="rfn348">[348]</a></sup> As
the brother of the wife whom Mr Francis had left at home, and on his own
account as a fascinating courtier, he cast a powerful but baleful influence
upon the household in Geneva. Marcombes was at first very guarded in his
remarks, writing only that "Mr Kyligry is here since Saturday Last ... but
I think he will not Stay long: which perhaps will be ye better for yr sons:
for although his conversation is very sweet and delectable yet they have no
need of interruption, specially Mr francis, which was much abused in his
Learning by his former teachers: and although he hath a great desire to
redime ye time, yet he cannot follow his younger brother, and therefore he
must have time, and avoid ye company of those yt care <a
name="Page_165"></a>not for their bookes."<sup><a href="#fn349"
name="rfn349">[349]</a></sup> But when it appeared that Killigrew had told
the Earl of Cork that Marcombes kept the brothers shabbily dressed, the
governor unfolded his opinion of the rising dramatist as "one that speakes
ill of his own mother and of all his friends and that plays ye foole
allwayes through ye streets like a Schoole Boy, having Allwayes his mouth
full of whoores and such discourses, and braging often of his getting mony
from this or ye other merchant without any good intention to pay."<sup><a
href="#fn350" name="rfn350">[350]</a></sup> His company fomented in Mr
Francis a boastful spirit, "never speaking of any thing but what he should
doe when he should once more command his state, how many dogs he shoulde
keepe; how many horses; how many fine bands, sutes and rubans, and how
freely he would play and keepe Company with good fellowes, etc."<sup><a
href="#fn351" name="rfn351">[351]</a></sup></p>

<i>From a contemporary caricature of the Restoration dramatist, who formed
some of his characteristics in France in 1640</i></p>

<p>Thomas Killigrew's sister, the wife of Mr Francis, was also a very
disturbing person. She would correspond with her husband and urge him to
run away from his tutor, and suggested coming to the Continent herself and
meeting him.<sup><a href="#fn352" name="rfn352">[352]</a></sup> These plots
she made with the assistance of her brother, whom she much resembled in <a
name="Page_166"></a>disposition.<sup><a href="#fn353"
name="rfn353">[353]</a></sup> There is no knowing what havoc she would have
made with the carefully planned education of the Boyles, for Francis at the
end of two years became dangerously restive, had not their tour been
decisively ended by the first rumblings of the Civil War at home.</p>

<p>After a winter in Italy, they were about to start for Paris to perfect
themselves in dancing and to begin riding the great horse, when they
received news that the Earl of Cork was ruined by the rebellion in Ireland.
He could send them no more money, he told them, than the two hundred and
fifty pounds he had just dispatched. By economizing, and dismissing their
servants, they might reach Holland, and enlist under the Prince of Orange.
They must now work out their fortune for themselves.<sup><a href="#fn354"
name="rfn354">[354]</a></sup></p>

<p>The two hundred and fifty pounds never came. They were embezzled by the
agent; and the Boyles were left penniless in a strange country. Marcombes
did not desert them, however. Robert, who was too frail for soldiering, he
kept with him in Geneva for two years. Francis, free at last, took horse,
was off to Ireland, and joined in the fighting beside his brothers
Dungarvan, <a name="Page_167"></a>Kynalmeaky, and Broghill, who rallied
around their father.<sup><a href="#fn355" name="rfn355">[355]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are several other seventeenth-century books on the theory of
travel besides Lassels', which would repay reading. But we have come to the
period when essays of this sort contain so many repetitions of one another,
that detailed comment would be tedious. Edward Leigh's <i>Three
Diatribes</i><sup><a href="#fn356" name="rfn356">[356]</a></sup> appeared
in 1671, a year after Lassels' book, and in 1678 Gailhard, another
professional governor, in his "Directions for the Education of youth as to
their Breeding at Home and Travelling Abroad,"<sup><a href="#fn357"
name="rfn357">[357]</a></sup> imitated Lassels' attention to the particular
needs of the country gentleman. "The honest country gentleman" is a synonym
for one apt to be fooled, one who has neither wit nor experience. He, above
all others, needs to go abroad to study the tempers of men and learn their
several fashions. "As to Country breeding, which is opposed to the Courts,
to the Cities, or to Travelling: when it is merely such, it is a clownish
one. Before a Gentleman comes to a settlement, Hawking, Coursing and
Hunting, are the dainties of it; then taking Tobacco, and going to the
Alehouse and Tavern, where matches are made for Races, Cock-fighting, and
<a name="Page_168"></a>the like." As opposed to this life, Gailhard holds
up the pattern of Sir Thomas Grosvenor, who did "strive after being
bettered with an Outlandish Breeding" by means of close application to the
French and Italian languages, to fencing, dancing, riding The Great Horse,
drawing landscapes, and learning the guitar. "His Moneys he did not trifle
away, but bestowed them upon good Books, Medals and other useful Rareties
worth the Curiosity of a Compleat Gentleman."<sup><a href="#fn358"
name="rfn358">[358]</a></sup></p>

<p>On comparing these instructions with those of the sixteenth century, one
is struck with the emphasis they lay upon drawing and "limning." This is
what we would expect in the seventeenth century, when an interest in
pictures, statues, and architecture was a distinguishing feature of a
gentleman. The Marquis de Seignelay, sent on a tour in 1617 by his father
Colbert, was accompanied by a painter and an architect charged to make him
understand the beauties of Italian art.<sup><a href="#fn359"
name="rfn359">[359]</a></sup> Antoine Delahaute, making the Grand Tour with
an Abb&eacute; for a governor, carried with him an artist as well, so that
when he came upon a fine site, he ordered the chaise to be stopped, and the
view to be drawn by the obedient draughtsman.<sup><a href="#fn360"
name="rfn360">[360]</a></sup> <a name="Page_169"></a>Not only did gentlemen
study to appreciate pictures, but they strove themselves to draw and paint.
In the travels of George Sandys<sup><a href="#fn361"
name="rfn361">[361]</a></sup> (edition 1615), may be seen a woodcut of
travellers, in the costume of Henry of Navarre, sketching at the side of
Lake Avernus. To take out one's memorandum-book and make a sketch of a
charming prospect, was the usual thing before the camera was invented.
"Before I went to bed I took a landscape of this pleasant terrace," says
Evelyn in Roane.<sup><a href="#fn362" name="rfn362">[362]</a></sup> At
Tournon, where he saw a very strong castle under a high precipice, "The
prospect was so tempting that I could not forbear designing it with my
crayon."<sup><a href="#fn363" name="rfn363">[363]</a></sup> Consequently,
we find instructions for travellers reflecting the tastes of the time:
Gerbier's <i>Subsidium Peregrinantibus</i>, for instance, insisting on a
knowledge of "Perspective, Sculpture, Architecture and Pictures," as among
the requisites of a polite education, lays great stress on the
identification and survey of works of art as one of the main duties of a
traveller.<sup><a href="#fn364" name="rfn364">[364]</a></sup></p>

<p>Significant as are the instructions of Gerbier, <a
name="Page_170"></a>Lassels, and others of this period, there are some
directions for an education abroad which are more interesting than these
products of professional tutors--instructions written by one who was
himself the perfect gentleman of his day. The Earl of Chesterfield's
letters to his son define the purpose of a foreign education with a freedom
which is lacking in the book of a governor who writes for the public eye.
Though the contents of the letters are familiar to everyone, their
connection with travel for "cultum animi" has hitherto, I think, been
overlooked.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the earl sent his son abroad at the age of
fourteen to study for five years on the Continent, and to acquire a better
preparation for life than Oxford or Cambridge could offer. Of these
universities Chesterfield had a low opinion. He could not sufficiently
scorn an education which did not prevent a man from being flurried at his
Presentation to the King. He remembered that he himself, when he was first
introduced into good company, with all the awkwardness and rust of
Cambridge about him, was frightened out of his wits. At Cambridge he "had
acquired among the pedants of an illiberal seminary a turn for satire and
contempt, and a strong tendency to argumentation and contradiction," which
was a hindrance to his progress <a name="Page_171"></a>in the polite world.
Only after a continental education did he see the follies of Englishmen who
knew nothing of modern Europe, who were always talking of the Ancients as
something more than men, and of the Moderns as something less. "They are
never without a classic or two in their pockets; they stick to the old good
sense; they read none of modern trash; and will show you plainly that no
improvement has been made, in any one art or science, these last seventeen
hundred years."<sup><a href="#fn365" name="rfn365">[365]</a></sup></p>

<p>His son, therefore, was to waste no time in the society of pedants, but
accompanied by a travelling tutor, was to begin studying life first-hand at
the Courts. His book-learning was to go side by side with the study of
manners:</p>

<p>"Courts and Camps are the only places to learn the world in. There alone
all kinds of characters resort, and human nature is seen in all the various
shapes and modes ... whereas, in all other places, one local mode generally
prevails."<sup><a href="#fn366" name="rfn366">[366]</a></sup></p>

<p>Moreover, the earl did not think that a company wholly composed of men
of learning could be called good company. "They cannot have the easy
manners and tournure of the world, as they do not live in it." And an
engaging address, "an insinuating behaviour," was to be <a
name="Page_172"></a>sought for early in life, and, at the same time, with
the solid parts of learning. "The Scholar, without good breeding, is a
Pedant: the Philosopher, a Cynic: the Soldier, a Brute: and every man
disagreeable."<sup><a href="#fn367" name="rfn367">[367]</a></sup></p>

<p>The five years of young Stanhope's travel were carefully distributed as
follows: a year in Lausanne,<sup><a href="#fn368"
name="rfn368">[368]</a></sup> for the rudiments of languages; a year in
Leipsic, for a thorough grounding in history and jurisprudence; a year
spent in visits to such cities as Berlin, Dresden, and Vienna, for a view
of the different Courts; one in Italy, to get rid of the manners of
Germany; and one in Paris, to give him the final polish, the supreme touch,
of gentlemanly complaisance, politeness, and ease.</p>

<p>We may pass over the years in Germany, as the earl did, without much
comment. Young Stanhope was quite satisfactory in the more solid parts of
learning, and it was not until he reached Italy, there to begin his courtly
training, that Chesterfield's interest was fully aroused.</p>

<p>"The manners of Leipsig must be shook off," <a name="Page_173"></a>he
says emphatically. "No scramblings at your meals as at a German ordinary:
no awkward overturns of glasses, plates, and salt-cellers."<sup><a
href="#fn369" name="rfn369">[369]</a></sup></p>

<p>He is to mind the decent mirth of the courtiers--their discreet
frankness, their natural, careless, but genteel air; in short, to acquire
the Graces. Chesterfield sent letters of introduction to the best company
in Venice, forwarded his own diamond shoe buckles for his son, and began to
pour forth advice on the possible social problems confronting a young
Englishman in Rome. With a contemptuous tolerance for Papists, Protestants,
and all religious quarrels as obstructions to the art of pleasing, he bade
Stanhope be civil to the Pope, and to kneel down while the Host was being
carried through the streets. His tutor, though, had better not. With
wonderful artistic insight, the earl perceives that the fitting attitude
for Mr Harte is simple, ungracious honesty.<sup><a href="#fn370"
name="rfn370">[370]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the subject of the Pretender, then resident in Rome, his advice is;
never meet a Stuart at all if you can help it; but if you must, feign
ignorance of him and his grievances. If he begins to talk politics, disavow
any knowledge of events in England, and escape as soon as you can.<sup><a
href="#fn371" name="rfn371">[371]</a></sup></p>

<p>Long before his son's year in Italy was completed, <a
name="Page_174"></a>Chesterfield began preparing him for Paris. For the
first six months Stanhope was to live in an academy with young Frenchmen of
fashion; after that, to have lodgings of his own. The mornings were to
belong to study, or serious conversation with men of learning or figure;
the afternoons, to exercise; the evenings to be free for balls, the opera,
or play. These are the pleasures of a gentleman, for which his father is
willing to pay generously. But he will not, he points out frequently,
subscribe to the extravagance of a rake. The eighteen-year-old Stanhope is
to have his coach, his two valets and a footman, the very best French
clothes--in fact, everything that is sensible. But he shall not be allowed
money for dozens of cane-heads, or fancy snuff-boxes, or excessive gaming,
or the support of opera-singers. One handsome snuff-box, one handsome
sword, and gaming only when the presence of the ladies keeps down high
stakes; but no tavern-suppers--no low company which costs so much more than
dissipations among one's equals. There is no need for a young man of any
address to make love to his laundress,<sup><a href="#fn372"
name="rfn372">[372]</a></sup> as long as ladies of his own class stoop to
folly.</p>

<p>Above all, Stanhope is not to associate with his own countrymen in
Paris. On them Chesterfield <a name="Page_175"></a>is never tired of
pouring the vials of scorn. He began while Stanhope was at Leipsic to point
out the deficiences of English boys:</p>

<p>"They are commonly twenty years old before they have spoken to anybody
above their schoolmaster, and the Fellows of their college. If they happen
to have learning, it is only Greek and Latin; but not one word of modern
history, or modern languages. Thus prepared, they go abroad as they call
it; but in truth, they stay at home all that while; for being very awkward,
confoundedly ashamed, and not speaking the languages, they go into no
foreign company, at least none good, but dine and sup with one another
only, at the tavern.<sup><a href="#fn373"
name="rfn373">[373]</a></sup>...</p>

<p>"The life of les Milords Anglais is regularly, or if you will,
irregularly, this. As soon as they rise, which is very late, they breakfast
together to the utter loss of two good morning hours. Then they go by
coachfuls to the Palais, the Invalides, and Notre-Dame; from thence to the
English coffee-house where they make up their tavern party for dinner. From
dinner, where they drink quick, they adjourn in clusters to the play, where
they crowd up the stage, drest up in very fine clothes, very ill made by a
Scotch or Irish tailor. From the play to the tavern again, where they get
<a name="Page_176"></a>very drunk, and where they either quarrel among
themselves, or sally forth, commit some riot in the streets, and are taken
up by the watch."<sup><a href="#fn374" name="rfn374">[374]</a></sup></p>

<p>To avoid these monsters, and to cultivate the best French society, was
what a wise young man must do in Paris. He must establish an intimacy with
the best French families. If he became fashionable among the French, he
would be fashionable in London.</p>

<p>Chesterfield considered it best to show no erudition at Paris before the
rather illiterate society there. As the young men were all bred for and put
into the army at the age of twelve or thirteen, only the women had any
knowledge of letters. Stanhope would find at the academy a number of young
fellows ignorant of books, and at that age hasty and petulant, so that the
avoidance of quarrels must be a young Englishman's great care. He will be
as lively as these French boys, but a little wiser; he will not reproach
them with their ignorance, nor allow their idlenesses to break in on the
hours he has laid aside for study.</p>

<p>Such was the plan of a Grand Tour laid down by one of the first
gentlemen of Europe. It remains one of the best expressions of the social
influence of France upon England, and for that <a
name="Page_177"></a>reason properly belongs to the seventeenth century more
than to the Georgian era in which the letters were written. Chesterfield
might be called the last of the courtiers. He believed in accomplishments
and personal elegance as a means of advancing oneself in the world, long
after the Court had ceased to care for such qualities, or to be of much
account in the destinies of leading Englishmen. Republicanism was in the
air. Chesterfield was thinking of the France of his youth; but France had
changed. In 1765, Horace Walpole was depressed by the solemnity and
austerity of French society. Their style of conversation was serious,
pedantic, and seldom animated except by a dispute on some philosophic
subject.<sup><a href="#fn375" name="rfn375">[375]</a></sup> In fact,
Chesterfield was admiring the France of Louis the Fourteenth long after "Le
Soleil" had set, and the country was sombre. It was the eve of the day when
France was to imitate the democratic ideals of England. England, at last,
instead of being on the outskirts of civilization, was coming to be the
most powerful, respected, and enlightened country in Europe. When that day
dawned, Englishmen no longer sought the Continent in the spirit of the
Elizabethans--the spirit which aimed at being "A citizen of the whole
world."</p>

<a name="Page_178"></a><h2><a name='CHAPTER_VII'></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE DECADENCE OF THE GRAND TOUR.</h3>


<p>During the several generations when the Stuarts communicated their love
of France to the aristocracy of England, there was, as we might suppose, a
steady undercurrent of protest against this Gallic influence. A returning
traveller would be pursued by the rabble of London, who, sighting his
French periwig and foreign gestures, would pelt his coach with gutter-dirt,
squibs, roots and rams-horns, and run after it shouting "French Dogs!
French Dogs! A Mounser! A Mounser!"<sup><a href="#fn376"
name="rfn376">[376]</a></sup> Between the courtiers and the true-born
Englishman there was no great sympathy in the matter of foreign culture.
The courtiers too often took towards deep-seated English customs the
irreverent attitude of their master, Charles II.--known to remark that it
was the roast beef and reading of the holy Scriptures that caused the noted
sadness of the English.<sup><a href="#fn377" name="rfn377">[377]</a></sup>
The true-born Englishman <a name="Page_179"></a>retorted with many a jibe
at the "gay, giddy, brisk, insipid fool," who thought of nothing but
clothes and garnitures, despised roast beef, and called his old friends
ruffians and rustics; or at the rake who "has not been come from France
above three months and here he has debauch'd four women and fought five
duels." The playwrights could always secure an audience by a skilful
portrait of an "English Mounsieur" such as Sir Fopling Flutter, who "went
to Paris a plain bashful English Blockhead and returned a fine undertaking
French Fop."<sup><a href="#fn378" name="rfn378">[378]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_180"></a>There had always been a protest against foreign
influence, but in the eighteenth century one cannot fail to notice a
stronger and more contemptuous attitude than ever before. England was
feeling her power. War with France sharpened the shafts of satire, and
every victory over the French increased a strong insular patriotism in all
classes. Foote declared residence in Paris a necessary part of every man of
fashion's education, because it "Gives 'em a relish for their own domestic
happiness and a proper veneration for their own national liberties."<sup><a
href="#fn379" name="rfn379">[379]</a></sup> His Epilogue to <i>The
Englishman in Paris</i> commends the prudence of British forefathers
who</p>

<blockquote>
"Scorned to truck for base unmanly arts,<br />
Their native plainness and their honest hearts."<sup><a href="#fn380"
name="rfn380">[380]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>It was not the populace alone, or those who appealed directly to the
populace, who sneered at Popish countries, and pitied them for not being
British.<sup><a href="#fn381" name="rfn381">[381]</a></sup> As time went on
Whigs of all classes boasted of the superiority of England, especially when
they travelled in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="Page_181"></a></p>
<blockquote>
"We envy not the warmer clime that lies<br />
In ten degrees of more indulgent skies ...<br />
'Tis Liberty that crowns Britannia's Isle<br />
And makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains smile."<sup><a
href="#fn382" name="rfn382">[382]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>Addison's travels are full of reflections of this sort. The destitution
of the Campagna of Rome demonstrates triumphantly what an aversion mankind
has to arbitrary government, while the well-populated mountain of St Marino
shows what a natural love they have for liberty. Whigs abroad were well
caricatured by Smollett in <i>Peregrine Pickle</i> in the figures of the
Painter and the Doctor. They observed that even the horses and dogs in
France were starved; whereupon the Governor of Peregrine, an Oxonian and a
Jacobite, sneered that they talked like true Englishmen. The Doctor,
affronted by the insinuation, told him with some warmth that he was wrong
in his conjecture, "his affections and ideas being confined to no
particular country; for he considered himself as a citizen of the world. He
owned himself more attached to England than to any other kingdom, but this
preference was the effect of reflection and not of prejudice."</p>

<p>This growing conviction of England's superiority helped to bring about
the decadence of travel for education. Travel continued, and the eighteenth
<a name="Page_182"></a>century was as noticeable as any other for the "mal
du pays" which attacked young men, but travel became the tour of curiosity
and diversion with which we are familiar, and not an earnest endeavour to
become "a compleat person." Many changes helped this decadence. The
"policy" of Italy and France, which once attracted the embryo statesmen of
Elizabeth, was now well known and needed no further study. With the passing
of the Stuarts, when the king's favour ceased to be the means of making
one's fortune, a courtly education was no longer profitable. High offices
under the Georges were as often as not filled by unpolished Englishmen
extolled for their native flavour of bluntness and bluffness. Foreign
graces were a superfluous ornament, more or less ridiculous. The majority
of Englishmen were wont to prize, as Sam Johnson did, "their rustic
grandeur and their surly grace," and to join in his lament:</p>

<blockquote>
"Lost in thoughtless ease and empty show,<br />
Behold the warrior dwindled to a beau;<br />
Sense, freedom, piety refined away,<br />
Of France the mimick and of Spain the prey."<sup><a href="#fn383"
name="rfn383">[383]</a></sup><br />
</blockquote>

<p>A large section of society was inimical to the kind of education that
the Earl of Chesterfield prescribed for his son. The earl was well aware of
it, indeed, and marked with repugnance divers <a name="Page_183"></a>young
bucks of his day with leathern breeches and unpowdered hair, who would
exclaim; "Damn these finical outlandish airs, give me a manly resolute
manner. They make a rout with their graces, and talk like a parcel of
dancing masters, and dress like a parcel of fops; one good Englishman will
beat three of them."<sup><a href="#fn384" name="rfn384">[384]</a></sup></p>

<p>Even during the height of the Grand Tour in the latter half of the
seventeenth century, thoughtful minds, observing the effects of a foreign
education as seen not only in the courtiers of Charles II., but in the
dozens of obscure country gentlemen who painfully sought to acquire the
habit of a Parisian Marquis by education abroad, noticed the weak points of
such a system. The Earl of Clarendon thought it pernicious to send boys
abroad until after they had gone through Oxford or Cambridge. There was no
necessity for their getting the French accent at an early age, "as if we
had no mind to be suspected to be Englishmen." That took them from their
own country at just the age when they ought to have severe mental
discipline, for the lack of which no amount of social training would make
them competent men. "They return from travel with a wonderful confidence
which may very well be called impudence ... all <a
name="Page_184"></a>their learning is in wearing their clothes well; they
have very much without their heads, very little within; and they are very
much more solicitous that their periwigs fit handsomely, than to speak
discreetly; they laugh at what they do not understand, which understanding
so little, makes their laughter very immoderate. When they have been at
home two or three years, which they spend in the vanities which they
brought over with them, fresh travellers arrive with newer fashions, and
the same confidence, and are looked upon as finer gentlemen, and wear their
ribbons more gracefully; at which the others are angry, quit the stage, and
would fain get into wiser company, where they every day find defects in
themselves, which they owe to the ill spending that time when they thought
only of being fine gentlemen."<sup><a href="#fn385"
name="rfn385">[385]</a></sup></p>

<p>When these products of a French education could not remain in town, but
were obliged to live on their estates amid rough country squires, it went
hard with them. "They will by no means embrace our way," says The Country
Gentleman in Clarendon's <i>Dialogue of the Want of Respect Due to Age</i>,
"but receive us with cringes and treat us with set speeches, and complain
<a name="Page_185"></a>how much it rains, that they cannot keep their hair
dry, or their linnen handsome one hour. They talk how much a better country
France is and how much they eat and drink better there, which our neighbors
will not believe, and laugh at them for saying so. They by no means endure
our exercises of hunting and hawking, nor indeed can their tender bodies
endure those violent motions. They have a guitar or some other fiddle,
which they play upon commonly an hour or so in their beds before they rise,
and have at least one French fellow to wait upon them, to shave them, and
comb their periwig; and he is sent into the kitchen to dress some little
dish, or to make some sauce for dinner, whom the cook is hardly restrained
from throwing into the fire. In a word, they live to and within themselves,
and their nearest neighbors do not know whether they eat and drink or
no."<sup><a href="#fn386" name="rfn386">[386]</a></sup></p>

<p>Not only were the recreations of their country neighbours violent and
unrefined, according to the English Messieurs, but that preoccupation with
local government, which was the chief duty of the country gentleman, was
beyond the capacity of those who by living abroad had learned little of the
laws and customs of their own country. Clarendon draws a sad picture of the
return of the <a name="Page_186"></a>native who was ashamed to be present
at the public and private meetings for the administration of justice,
because he had spent in dancing the time when he might have been storing
knowledge, and who now passed his days a-bed, reading French romances of
which he was tired.</p>

<p>Locke also set forth the fallacies of the Grand Tour in his <i>Essay of
Education</i>. He admitted that fencing and riding the Great Horse were
looked upon as "so necessary parts of breeding that it would be thought a
great omission to neglect them," but he questioned whether riding the Great
Horse was "of moment enough to be made a business of."<sup><a href="#fn387"
name="rfn387">[387]</a></sup> Fencing, he pointed out, has very little to
do with civil life, and is of no use in real warfare, while music "wastes
so much of a young man's time, to gain but a moderate skill in it, and
engages often in such odd company, that many think it much better
spared."<sup><a href="#fn388" name="rfn388">[388]</a></sup> But the feature
of travel which was most mercilessly analysed by Locke was the Governor. He
exposed the futility of sending a boy abroad to gain experience and to
mingle with good society while he was so young as to need a guardian. For
at the age when most boys were abroad--that is, from sixteen to
twenty-two--they thought themselves <a name="Page_187"></a>too much men to
be governed by others, and yet had not experience and prudence enough to
govern themselves. Under the shelter of a Governor they were excused from
being accountable for their own conduct and very seldom troubled themselves
with inquiries or with making useful observations of their own.</p>

<p class="figure"> <a name="etr011"><img width="80%"

AS TAUGHT BY ANTOINE PLUVINEL, THE RIDING-MASTER OF LOUIS XIII  <i>From 'Le
Maneige Royal,' by Antoine Pluvinel, 1624</i></p>

<p>While the Governor robbed his pupil of life's responsibilities on one
hand, he hampered him, on the other, in any efforts to get into good
company:</p>

<p>"I ask amongst our young men that go abroad under tutors what one is
there of an hundred, that ever visits any person of quality? much less
makes an acquaintance with such from whose conversation he may learn what
is good breeding in that country and what is worth observation in it....
Nor indeed is it to be wondered. For men of worth and parts will not easily
admit the familiarity of boys who yet need the care of a tutor: though a
young gentleman and stranger, appearing like a man, and shewing a desire to
inform himself in the customs, laws, and government of the country he is
in, will find welcome, assistance and entertainment everywhere."<sup><a
href="#fn389" name="rfn389">[389]</a></sup></p>

<p>These, and many comments of the same sort from other observers, made for
the disintegration <a name="Page_188"></a>of the Grand Tour, and cast
discredit upon it as a mode of education. Locke was not the only person who
exposed the ineffectiveness of governors. They became a favourite subject
of satire in the eighteenth century. Though even the best sort of
"ma&icirc;tre d'ours" or "bear-master," as the French called him, robbed
travel of its proper effect, the best were seldom available for the hosts
of boyish travellers. Generally the family chaplain was chosen, because of
his cheapness, and this unfortunate was expected to restrain the boisterous
devilment of the Peregrine Pickle committed to his care.<sup><a
href="#fn390" name="rfn390">[390]</a></sup> A booklet called <i>The
Bear-Leaders; or, Modern Travelling Stated in a Proper Light</i>, sums up a
biting condemnation of "our rugged unsocial Telemachuses and their
unpolished Mentors," describing how someone in orders, perhaps a family
dependent, is chosen as the Governor of the crude unprepared mortal
embarking for a tour of Europe. "The Oddities, when introduced to <a
name="Page_189"></a>each other, start back with mutual Astonishment, but
after some time from a frequency of seeing, grow into a Coarse Fondness one
for the other, expressed by Horse Laughs, or intimated by alternate Thumps
on the Back, with all such other gentle insinuations of our uncivilized
Male Hoydens."<sup><a href="#fn391" name="rfn391">[391]</a></sup></p>

<p>Small wonder, therefore, that a youth, who returned from driving by
post-chaise through the principal towns of Europe in the company of a meek
chaplain,<sup><a href="#fn392" name="rfn392">[392]</a></sup> returned from
his tour about as much refined, according to Congreve, "as a Dutch skipper
from a whale-fishing."<sup><a href="#fn393" name="rfn393">[393]</a></sup>
The whole idea of the Grand Tour was thrown into disrepute after its
adoption by crude and low-bred people, who thought it necessary to inform
all their acquaintance where they had been, by a very unbecoming dress and
a very awkward address: "not knowing that an Englishman's beef-and-pudding
face will not agree with a hat no bigger than a trencher; and that a man
who <a name="Page_190"></a>never learned to make a bow performs it worse in
a head of hair dressed a L'aille Pidgeon, than in a scratch wig."<sup><a
href="#fn394" name="rfn394">[394]</a></sup></p>

<p>In many other ways, also, travel lost its dignity in the eighteenth
century. It was no longer necessary to live in foreign countries to
understand them. With the foundation of the chairs of modern history at
Oxford and Cambridge by King George the First in 1724, one great reason for
travel was lost. Information about contemporary politics on the Continent
could be had through the increasing number of news-journals and gazettes.
As for learning the French language, there had been no lack of competent
teachers since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 sent French
Protestant refugees swarming across the channel to find some sort of living
in England. Therefore the spirit of acquisitiveness dwindled and died down,
in the absence of any strong need to study abroad, and an idle, frivolous,
darting, capricious spirit controlled the aristocratic tourist. Horace
Walpole on his travels spent his time in a way that would have been
censured by the Elizabethans. He rushed everywhere, played cards, danced
through the streets of Rheims before the ladies' coaches, <a
name="Page_191"></a>and hailed with delight every acquaintance from
England. What would Sir Philip Sidney have thought of the mode of life
Walpole draws in this letter:</p>

<p>"About two days ago, about four o'clock in the afternoon ... as we were
picking our teeth round a littered table and in a crumby room, Gray<sup><a
href="#fn395" name="rfn395">[395]</a></sup> in an undress, Mr Conway in a
morning-grey coat and I in a trim white night-gown and slippers, very much
out of order, with a very little cold, a message discomposed us all of a
sudden, with a service to Mr Walpole from Mr More, and that, if he pleased,
he would wait on Mr Walpole. We scuttle upstairs in great confusion, but
with no other damage than the flinging down two or three glasses and the
dropping a slipper by the way. Having ordered the room to be cleaned out,
and sent a very civil response to Mr More, we began to consider who Mr More
might be."<sup><a href="#fn396" name="rfn396">[396]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the tour of Walpole and Gray one may see a change in the interest of
travel; how the romantic spirit had already ousted the humanistic love of
men and cities. As he drifted through Europe Gray took little interest in
history or in <a name="Page_192"></a>the intricacies of human character. He
would not be bothered by going to Courts with Walpole, or if he did he
stood in the corner of the ballroom and looked on while Walpole danced.
What he cared for was La Grande Chartreuse, with its cliffs and pines and
torrents and hanging woods.<sup><a href="#fn397"
name="rfn397">[397]</a></sup> He is the forerunner of the Byronic traveller
who delighted in the terrific aspects of nature and disdained mankind.
Different indeed was the genial heart of Howell, who was at pains to hire
lodgings in Paris with windows opening on the street, that he might study
every passerby,<sup><a href="#fn398" name="rfn398">[398]</a></sup> but who
spoke of mountains in Spain in a casual way as "not so high and hideous as
the Alps," or as "uncouth, huge, monstrous Excrescences of Nature, bearing
nothing but craggy stones."<sup><a href="#fn399"
name="rfn399">[399]</a></sup></p>

<p>With the decline of enthusiasm over the serious <a
name="Page_193"></a>advantages of travel, there was not much demand for
those essays on the duties of the student abroad which we have tried to
describe. By the eighteenth century, hand-books for travellers were much
the same as those with which we are to-day familiar; that is, a guide-book
describing the particular objects to be inspected, and the sensations they
ought to inspire, together with exceedingly careful notes as to the price
of meals and transportation. This sort of manual became necessary when
travel grew to be the recreation of men of moderate education who could not
read the local guide-books written in the language of the country they
visited. Compilations such as the <i>Itinerarium Itali&aelig;</i> of
Schottus, published at Antwerp in 1600, and issued in eleven editions
during the seventeenth century, had been sufficient for the accomplished
traveller of the Renaissance.<sup><a href="#fn400"
name="rfn400">[400]</a></sup> <a name="Page_194"></a>France, as the centre
of travel, produced the greatest number of handy manuals,<sup><a
href="#fn401" name="rfn401">[401]</a></sup> and it was from these,
doubtless, that Richard Lassels drew the idea of composing a similar work
in the English language, which would comprise the exhortation to travel, in
the manner of Turler, with a continental guide to objects of art. <i>The
Voyage of Italy</i> by Lassels, published in Paris in 1670, marks the
beginning of guide-books in English.</p>

<p class="figure"> <a name="etr012"><img width="80%"
alt="Illustration: AN ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS"
src="images/etr012.png" /></a><br /> AN ERUPTION OF MOUNT
VESUVIUS A Governor showing his pupil the sights</p>

<p>Still, in succeeding vade-mecums there are some occasional echoes of the
old injunctions to improve one's time. Misson's <i>A New Voyage to
Italy</i>,<sup><a href="#fn402" name="rfn402">[402]</a></sup> maps out some
intellectual duties. According to Misson a voyager ought to carry along
with him a cane divided into several measures, or a piece of <a
name="Page_195"></a>pack-thread well twined and waxed, fifty fathom long
and divided into feet by knots, so as to be able to measure the height of
the towers and the bigness of pillars and the dimensions of everything so
far as he is able. This seems sufficiently laborious, but it makes for an
easy life compared to the one prescribed by Count Leopold Berchtold in his
<i>Essay to Direct and Extend the Inquiries of Patriotic Travellers</i>. He
would have one observe the laws and customs of foreigners with a curiosity
that would extend to every department of social and economic life,
beginning with "Causes of the Decrease of Population and Remedies to
prevent them"; proceeding to such matters as the state of the peasantry; to
questions applicable to manuring, ploughing, and the housing of black
cattle; or to an "Inquiry concerning Charitable Institutions such as one
for recovering Drowned and Strangled Persons"; or to the "Extent of Liberty
to Grown-up Young Ladies." In case the traveller is at a loss how to
conduct his investigation, a list of particular questions on the topics for
study is added by the author. A few random examples of this list are:</p>

<p>"Which are the favourite herbs of the sheep of this country?"</p>

<p>"Are there many instances of people having been bit by mad animals?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_196"></a>"Is the state of a bachelor aggravated and
rendered less desirable? By what means?"</p>

<p>"How much is paid per day for ploughing with two oxen? With two
horses?"</p>

<p>"Which food has been experienced to be most portable and most nourishing
for keeping a distressed ship's crew from starving?"</p>

<p>"What is the value of whales of different sizes?"</p>

<p>In addition to such inquiries Berchtold<sup><a href="#fn403"
name="rfn403">[403]</a></sup> urges the necessity of sketching landscapes
and costumes, and better yet, the scientific drawing of engines and
complicated machines, and also of acquiring skill on some musical
instrument, to keep one from the gaming table in one's idle hours,
preferably of learning to play on a portable instrument, such as a German
flute. Journals, it goes without saying, must be written every night before
the traveller goes to sleep.</p>

<p>It is not only the fact of their being addressed to persons of small
intelligence which makes the guide-books of the eighteenth century seem
ridiculous; another reason for their ignoble tone is the increased emphasis
they lay on the material convenience of the traveller. Not the service of
one's country or the perfecting of one's character <a
name="Page_197"></a>is the note of Georgian injunctions, but the fear of
being cheated and of being sick. Misson's instructions begin at once with
praise of fixed rates in Holland, where one is spared the exhaustion of
wrangling. The exact fare from Cologne to Maintz is his next subject, and
how one can hire a coach and six horses for three crowns a day; how the
best inns at Venice are The Louvre, The White Lion, and The French Arms;
how one can stay at The Louvre for eight livres a day and pay seven or
eight livres for a gondola by the day, and so forth; with similar useful
but uninspired matter. Next he discusses sea-sickness, and informs us that
the best remedy is to keep always, night and day, a piece of earth under
the nose; for which purpose you should provide a sufficient quantity of
earth and preserve it fresh in a pot of clay; and when you have used a
piece so long that it begins to grow dry, put it again into the pot, and
take out some fresh earth.<sup><a href="#fn404"
name="rfn404">[404]</a></sup></p>

<p>Berchtold's suggestions for comfort are even more elaborate. One should
carry everywhere:</p>

<blockquote>
"A bottle of vinegar, de quatre voleurs.<br />
Ditto best French Brandy.<br />
Ditto spirit of Salmiac, against fits.<br />
Ditto Hoffman's Drops."<br />
</blockquote>

<p><a name="Page_198"></a>At inns it is advisable to air the room by
throwing a little strong vinegar upon a red hot shovel, and to bring your
bed-clothes with you. As a guard against robbers it is advisable to have
your servant sleep in the same room with you, keep a wax candle burning all
night, and look into the chests and behind the bed before retiring. Pocket
door-bolts in the form of a cross are easily obtainable; if not, put the
tables and chair against the door.</p>

<p>There is something fussy about such a traveller, though robbers
undoubtedly were to be feared, even in the eighteenth century,<sup><a
href="#fn405" name="rfn405">[405]</a></sup> and though inns were
undoubtedly dirty. A repugnance to dirt and discomfort is justifiable
enough, but there is something especially peevish in the tone of many
Georgian travellers. Sam Sharp's <i>Letters from Italy</i> breathe only
sorrow, disillusion and indignation. Italian beds and vermin, Italian
post-boys and their sorry nags are too frequently the theme of his
discourse. He even assures us that the young gentlemen whom he had always
pictured as highly delighted by the Grand Tour are in <a
name="Page_199"></a>reality very homesick for England. They are weary of
the interminable drives and interminable conversazioni of Italy and long
for the fox-hunting of Great Britain.<sup><a href="#fn406"
name="rfn406">[406]</a></sup> Fielding's account of his voyage to Lisbon
contains too much about his wife's toothache and his own dropsy.<sup><a
href="#fn407" name="rfn407">[407]</a></sup> Smollett, like Fielding, was a
sick man at the time of his travels, and we can excuse his rage at the
unswept floors, old rotten tables, crazy chairs and beds so disgusting that
he generally wrapped himself in a great-coat and lay upon four chairs with
a leathern portmanteau for a pillow; but we cannot admire a man who is
embittered by the fact that he cannot get milk to put in his tea, and is
continually thrusting his head out of the window to curse at the post-boys,
or pulling out his post-book to read to an inn-yard with savage
vociferation the article which orders that the traveller who comes first
shall be first served.<sup><a href="#fn408"
name="rfn408">[408]</a></sup></p>

<p>This is a degeneration from the undaunted mettle of the Elizabethans,
who, though acquainted with dirty inns and cheating landlords, kept their
spirits soaring above the material difficulties of travel. We miss, in
eighteenth century accounts, <a name="Page_200"></a>the gaiety of Roger
Ascham's Report of Germany and of the fair barge with goodly glass windows
in which he went up the Rhine--gaiety which does not fail even when he had
to spend the night in the barge, with his tired head on his saddle for a
bolster.<sup><a href="#fn409" name="rfn409">[409]</a></sup> We miss the
spirit of good fellowship with which John Taylor, the Water Poet, shared
with six strangers in the coach from Hamburgh the ribs of roast beef
brought with him from Great Britain.<sup><a href="#fn410"
name="rfn410">[410]</a></sup> Vastly diverting as the eighteenth-century
travel-books sometimes are, there is nothing in them that warms the heart
like the travels of poor Tom Coryat, that infatuated tourist, chief of the
tribe of Gad, whom nothing daunted in his determination to see the world.
Often he slept in wagons and in open skiffs, and though he could not afford
to hire the guides with Sedan chairs who took men over the Alpine passes in
those days, yet he followed them on foot, panting.<sup><a href="#fn411"
name="rfn411">[411]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Page_201"></a>So, in spite of the fact that travel is
never-ending, and that "peregrinatio animi causa" of the sixteenth century
is not very different from the Wanderlust of the nineteenth, we feel we
have come to the end of the particular phase of travel which had its
beginning in the Renaissance. The passing of the courtier, the widened
scope of the university, the rise of journalism, and the ascendancy of
England, changed the attitude of the English traveller from eager
acquisitiveness to complacent amusement. With this change of attitude came
an end to the essay in praise of travel, written by scholars and gentlemen
for their kind; intended for him "Who, whithersoever he directeth his
journey, travelleth for the greater benefit of his wit, for the commodity
of his studies, and dexterity of his life,--he who moveth more in mind than
in body."<sup><a href="#fn412" name="rfn412">[412]</a></sup> We hope we
have done something to rescue these essays from the oblivion into which
they have fallen, to show the social background from which they emerged,
and to reproduce their enthusiasm for self-improvement and their
high-hearted contempt for an easy, indolent life.</p>

<p>The embarrassments of an ambassador under these circumstances are hardly
exaggerated, perhaps, in Chapman's play, <i>Monsieur D'Olive</i>, where the
fictitious statesman bursts into a protest:</p>

<p>"Heaven I beseech thee, what an abhominable sort of Followers have I put
upon mee: ... I cannot looke into the Cittie, but one or other makes tender
his good partes to me, either his Language, his Travaile, his Intelligence,
or something: Gentlemen send me their younger Sonnes furnisht in compleat,
to learn fashions, for-sooth: as if the riding of five hundred miles, and
spending 1000 Crownes would make 'am wiser then God meant to make 'am....
Three hundred of these Gold-finches I have entertained for my Followers: I
can go in no corner, but I meete with some of my Wifflers in there
accoutrements; you may heare 'am halfe a mile ere they come at you, and
smell 'am half an hour after they are past you: sixe or seaven make a
perfect Morrice-daunce; they need no Bells, their Spurs serve their turne:
I am ashamed to traine 'am abroade, theyle say I carrie a whole Forrest of
Feathers with mee, and I should plod afore 'am in plaine stuffe, like a
writing Schole-maister before his Boyes when they goe a feasting."</p>

London, aged seventy, and a professed Protestant." He "was in his sicknesse
seduced to the Romish Religion." Recovering, a dispute was held at his
request between two Jesuits and two Protestant Divines, on the subject of
the Visibility of the Church. "This conference did so satisfie Master
Buggs, that renouncing his former wavering, he was confirmed in the

Matthew, son of the Archbishop of York, converted during his travels in
Italy. This witty and frivolous courtier came home and faced the uproar of
his friends, spent a whole plague-stricken summer in Fleet arguing with the
Bishops sent to reclaim him, and then was banished. After ten years he
reappeared at Court, as amusing as ever, the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the
Duke of Buckingham. But under the mask of frippery he worked unsleepingly
to advance the Church of Rome, for he had secretly taken orders as a Jesuit
Priest. See <i>Life of Sir Tobie Matthew</i>, by A.H. Mathew, London,

mind in John Nicolls, who, in 1577 left England, made a recantation of his
heresy, and was "received into the holy Catholic Church." Returning to
England he recanted his Roman Catholic opinions, and even wrote "His
Pilgrimage, wherein is displayed the lives of the proud Popes, ambitious
Cardinals, leacherous Bishops, fat bellied Monks, and hypocritical Jesuits"
(1581). Notwithstanding which, he went beyond the seas again (to turn
Mohometan, his enemies said), and under threats and imprisonment at Rouen,
recanted all that he had formerly uttered against the
Romanists.--<i>Athen&aelig; Oxonienses</i>, ed. Bliss, i. p. 496.</p>

<p><a href="#rfn224" name="fn224">224.</a>   The first edition of <i>The
View of Fraunce</i> was printed anonymously in 1604 by Symon Stafford: When
Thomas Creede brought out another edition, apparently in 1606, Dallington
inserted a preface "To All Gentlemen that have Travelled," and <i>A Method
for Travell</i>, consisting of eight unpaged leaves, and a folded leaf
containing a conspectus of <i>A Method for Travell</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#rfn225" name="fn225">225.</a>   As the use of Latin waned, a
knowledge of modern languages became increasingly important. The attitude
of continental gentlemen on this point is indicated by a Spanish Ambassador
in 1613, to whom the Pope's Nuncio used a German Punctilio, of speaking
Latin, for more dignity, to him and Italian to the Residents of Mantua and
Urbino. The Ambassador answered in Italian, "and afterwards gave this
reason for it: that it were as ill a Decorum for a Cavalier to speak Latin,
as for a Priest to use any other Language." (<i>Winwood Memorials</i>, vol.
iii. p. 446).</p>

<p><a href="#rfn226" name="fn226">226.</a>   Fynes Moryson had a great deal
to say on this subject. In particular, he instances the Germans as
reprehensible in living only with their own countrymen in Italy, "never
attaining the perfect use of any forreigne Language, be it never so easy.
So as myselfe remember one of them, who being reprehended, that having been
thirty yeeres in Italy hee could not speake the Language, he did merrily
answer in Dutch: Ah lieber was kan man doch in dreissig Jahr lehrnen? Alas,
good Sir, what can a man learne in thirty yeeres?" (<i>Itinerary,</i> vol.
in. p. 379).</p>

Coursers, Nags, and other common horses. These animals of "prodigious
weight" had to be taught to perform manoeuvres, and their riders, the art
of managing them according to certain rules and principles. See <i>A New
Method ... to Dress Horses</i>, by William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle,

Gibbon received the education he considered far superior to what could be
had from Oxford. When he returned to England, after four years, he missed
the "elegant and rational society" of Lausanne, and could not love
London--"the noisy and expensive scene of crowds without company, and
dissipation without pleasure."</p>

<p>The Abbe le Blanc on visiting England was very indignant at the
representation of his countrymen on the London stage: he describes how,
"Two actors came in, one dressed in the English manner very decently, and
the other with black eye-brows, a riband an ell long under his chin, a big
peruke immoderately powdered, and his nose all bedaubed with snuff. What
Englishman could not know a Frenchman by this ridiculous picture?... But
when it was found that the man thus equipped, being also laced down every
seam of his coat, was nothing but a cook, the spectators were equally
charmed and surprised. The author had taken care to make him speak all the
impertinences he could devise.... There was a long criticism upon our
manners, our customs and above all, our cookery. The excellence and virtues
of English beef were cried up; the author maintained that it was owing to
the quality of its juice that the English were so courageous, and had such
a solidity of understanding which raised them above all the nations of
Europe" (E. Smith, <i>Foreign Visitors In England</i>, London, 1889, pp.
193-4).</p>

<p>The Renaissance traveller had little commendation for a land that was
not fruitful, rich with grains and orchards. A landscape that suggested
food was to him the fairest landscape under heaven. Far from being an
admirer of mountains, he was of the opinion of Dr Johnson that "an eye
accustomed to flowery pastures and waving harvests is astonished and
repelled by this wide extent of hopeless sterility" and that "this
uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller"

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
